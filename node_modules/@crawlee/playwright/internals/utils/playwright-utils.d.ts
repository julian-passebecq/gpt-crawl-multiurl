     * {@apilink RequestQueue}. This is useful to crawl JavaScript heavy pages where links are not available

     * If you're looking to find URLs in `href` attributes of the page, see {@apilink enqueueLinks}.

     * and override settings of the enqueued {@apilink Request} objects.

     * **USING HEADFUL BROWSER**: When using a headful browser, this function will only be able to click elements
     * in the focused tab, effectively limiting concurrency to 1. In headless mode, full concurrency can be achieved.
     *
     * **PERFORMANCE**: Clicking elements with a mouse and intercepting requests is not a low level operation
     * that takes nanoseconds. It's not very CPU intensive, but it takes time. We strongly recommend limiting
     * the scope of the clicking as much as possible by using a specific selector that targets only the elements
     * that you assume or know will produce a navigation. You can certainly click everything by using
     * the `*` selector, but be prepared to wait minutes to get results on a large and complex page.
