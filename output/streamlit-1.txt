Quickstart

This is a concise set of steps to create your Streamlit Community Cloud account, deploy a sample app, and start editing it with GitHub Codespaces. For other options and complete explanations, start with Create your account.

You will be signing in to your Google and GitHub accounts during this process. If you do not already have these accounts, you can create them before you begin. If you do not want to use a Google account, you can create your account with any email.

Sign up for Streamlit Community Cloud
Go to share.streamlit.io/signup.
Click "Continue with Google".
Enter your Google credentials and follow Google's authentication prompts.
After authenticating with Google, click "Connect GitHub account".
Enter your GitHub credentials and follow GitHub's authentication prompts.
Click "Authorize streamlit".
To finish, fill in your information and click "Continue" at the bottom of the screen.
You will be taken to your Streamlit workspace. If you see a warning icon (warning) next to "Settings" in the upper-right corner, this will be addressed in the next steps.
Create a new app with GitHub Codespaces
Click the down arrow (expand_more) to expand the options under "New App".
Click "Create new app with GitHub Codespaces".
You will be prompted that "Streamlit is requesting additional permissions". Click "Authorize streamlit".
The Streamlit Hello repository will be forked to your GitHub account. Fill in a repository name and click "Create!"
Click "Create new codespace" to confirm the creation of a codespace on your GitHub account. Read more about GitHub Codespaces the learn about monthly limits for free use and paid plans.
Wait for GitHub to set up your codespace.
GitHub will automatically execute the commands to launch your Streamlit app within your codespace. Your app will be visible in a "Simple Browser" on the right. This may take a minute to complete from when your codespace first appears on screen.
Edit your app in GitHub Codespaces
Go to the app's main file (Hello.py) and add some text to the title in st.write(). Try typing ":balloon:" at the beginning.
Files are automatically saved in your codespace with each edit. Click "Always rerun" in the upper-right corner of your app to automatically rerun with each edit.
See your edits and keep going!
Stop or delete your codespace

When you are done, remember to stop your codespace on GitHub to avoid any undesired use of your capacity.

Go to github.com/codespaces. At the bottom of the page, all your codespaces are listed. Click the overflow menu icon (more_horiz) for your codespace.

Click "Stop codespace" if you'd like to return to your work later. Otherwise, click "Delete."

Congratulations! You just deployed an app to Streamlit Community Cloud. üéâ Head back to your workspace at share.streamlit.io/ and deploy another Streamlit app.

Connect Streamlit to TigerGraph
Introduction

This guide explains how to securely access a TigerGraph database from Streamlit Community Cloud. It uses the pyTigerGraph library and Streamlit's Secrets management.

Create a TigerGraph Cloud Database

First, follow the official tutorials to create a TigerGraph instance in TigerGraph Cloud, either as a blog or a video. Note your username, password, and subdomain.

For this tutorial, we will be using the COVID-19 starter kit. When setting up your solution, select the ‚ÄúCOVID-19 Analysis" option.

Once it is started, ensure your data is downloaded and queries are installed.

Add username and password to your local app secrets

Your local Streamlit app will read secrets from a file .streamlit/secrets.toml in your app‚Äôs root directory. Create this file if it doesn‚Äôt exist yet and add your TigerGraph Cloud instance username, password, graph name, and subdomain as shown below:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml

[tigergraph]
host = "https://xxx.i.tgcloud.io/"
username = "xxx"
password = "xxx"
graphname = "xxx"

priority_high
Important

Add this file to .gitignore and don't commit it to your GitHub repo!

Copy your app secrets to the cloud

As the secrets.toml file above is not committed to GitHub, you need to pass its content to your deployed app (on Streamlit Community Cloud) separately. Go to the app dashboard and in the app's dropdown menu, click on Edit Secrets. Copy the content of secrets.toml into the text area. More information is available at Secrets management.

Add PyTigerGraph to your requirements file

Add the pyTigerGraph package to your requirements.txt file, preferably pinning its version (replace x.x.x with the version you want installed):

# requirements.txt
pyTigerGraph==x.x.x

Write your Streamlit app

Copy the code below to your Streamlit app and run it. Make sure to adapt the name of your graph and query.

# streamlit_app.py

import streamlit as st
import pyTigerGraph as tg

# Initialize connection.
conn = tg.TigerGraphConnection(**st.secrets["tigergraph"])
conn.apiToken = conn.getToken(conn.createSecret())

# Pull data from the graph by running the "mostDirectInfections" query.
# Uses st.cache_data to only rerun when the query changes or after 10 min.
@st.cache_data(ttl=600)
def get_data():
    most_infections = conn.runInstalledQuery("mostDirectInfections")[0]["Answer"][0]
    return most_infections["v_id"], most_infections["attributes"]

items = get_data()

# Print results.
st.title(f"Patient {items[0]} has the most direct infections")
for key, val in items[1].items():
    st.write(f"Patient {items[0]}'s {key} is {val}.")


See st.cache_data above? Without it, Streamlit would run the query every time the app reruns (e.g. on a widget interaction). With st.cache_data, it only runs when the query changes or after 10 minutes (that's what ttl is for). Watch out: If your database updates more frequently, you should adapt ttl or remove caching so viewers always see the latest data. Learn more in Caching.

If everything worked out (and you used the example data we created above), your app should look like this:

Connect Streamlit to TiDB
Introduction

This guide explains how to securely access a remote TiDB database from Streamlit Community Cloud. It uses st.connection and Streamlit's Secrets management. The below example code will only work on Streamlit version >= 1.28, when st.connection was added.

TiDB is an open-source, MySQL-compatible database that supports Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) workloads. TiDB Cloud is a fully managed cloud database service that simplifies the deployment and management of TiDB databases for developers.

Sign in to TiDB Cloud and create a cluster

First, head over to TiDB Cloud and sign up for a free account, using either Google, GitHub, Microsoft or E-mail:

Once you've signed in, you will already have a TiDB cluster:

You can create more clusters if you want to. Click the cluster name to enter cluster overview page:

Then click Connect to easily get the connection arguments to access the cluster. On the popup, click Generate password to set the password.

priority_high
Important

Make sure to note down the password. It won't be available on TiDB Cloud after this step.

Create a TiDB database
push_pin
Note

If you already have a database that you want to use, feel free to skip to the next step.

Once your TiDB cluster is up and running, connect to it with the mysql client(or with Chat2Query tab on the console) and enter the following commands to create a database and a table with some example values:

CREATE DATABASE pets;

USE pets;

CREATE TABLE mytable (
    name            varchar(80),
    pet             varchar(80)
);

INSERT INTO mytable VALUES ('Mary', 'dog'), ('John', 'cat'), ('Robert', 'bird');

Add username and password to your local app secrets

Your local Streamlit app will read secrets from a file .streamlit/secrets.toml in your app's root directory. Learn more about Streamlit secrets management here. Create this file if it doesn't exist yet and add host, username and password of your TiDB cluster as shown below:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml

[connections.tidb]
dialect = "mysql"
host = "<TiDB_cluster_host>"
port = 4000
database = "pets"
username = "<TiDB_cluster_user>"
password = "<TiDB_cluster_password>"

priority_high
Important

When copying your app secrets to Streamlit Community Cloud, be sure to replace the values of host, username and password with those of your remote TiDB cluster!

Add this file to .gitignore and don't commit it to your GitHub repo!

Copy your app secrets to the cloud

As the secrets.toml file above is not committed to GitHub, you need to pass its content to your deployed app (on Streamlit Community Cloud) separately. Go to the app dashboard and in the app's dropdown menu, click on Edit Secrets. Copy the content of secrets.toml into the text area. More information is available at Secrets management.

Add dependencies to your requirements file

Add the mysqlclient and SQLAlchemy packages to your requirements.txt file, preferably pinning its version (replace x.x.x with the version you want installed):

# requirements.txt
mysqlclient==x.x.x
SQLAlchemy==x.x.x

Write your Streamlit app

Copy the code below to your Streamlit app and run it. Make sure to adapt query to use the name of your table.

# streamlit_app.py

import streamlit as st

# Initialize connection.
conn = st.connection('tidb', type='sql')

# Perform query.
df = conn.query('SELECT * from mytable;', ttl=600)

# Print results.
for row in df.itertuples():
    st.write(f"{row.name} has a :{row.pet}:")


See st.connection above? This handles secrets retrieval, setup, query caching and retries. By default, query() results are cached without expiring. In this case, we set ttl=600 to ensure the query result is cached for no longer than 10 minutes. You can also set ttl=0 to disable caching. Learn more in Caching.

If everything worked out (and you used the example table we created above), your app should look like this:

Connect with PyMySQL

Other than mysqlclient, PyMySQL is another popular MySQL Python client. To use PyMySQL, first you need to adapt your requirements file:

# requirements.txt
PyMySQL==x.x.x
SQLAlchemy==x.x.x


Then adapt your secrets file:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml

[connections.tidb]
dialect = "mysql"
driver = "pymysql"
host = "<TiDB_cluster_host>"
port = 4000
database = "pets"
username = "<TiDB_cluster_user>"
password = "<TiDB_cluster_password>"
create_engine_kwargs = { connect_args = { ssl = { ca = "<path_to_CA_store>" }}}

Connect Streamlit to Tableau
Introduction

This guide explains how to securely access data on Tableau from Streamlit Community Cloud. It uses the tableauserverclient library and Streamlit's Secrets management.

Create a Tableau site
push_pin
Note

If you already have a database that you want to use, feel free to skip to the next step.

For simplicity, we are using the cloud version of Tableau here but this guide works equally well for self-hosted deployments. First, sign up for Tableau Online or log in. Create a workbook or run one of the example workbooks under "Dashboard Starters".

Create personal access tokens

While the Tableau API allows authentication via username and password, you should use personal access tokens for a production app.

Go to your Tableau Online homepage, create an access token and note down the token name and secret.

push_pin
Note

Personal access tokens will expire if not used after 15 consecutive days.

Add token to your local app secrets

Your local Streamlit app will read secrets from a file .streamlit/secrets.toml in your app's root directory. Create this file if it doesn't exist yet and add your token, the site name you created during setup, and the URL of your Tableau server like below:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml

[tableau]
token_name = "xxx"
token_secret = "xxx"
server_url = "https://abc01.online.tableau.com/"
site_id = "streamlitexample"  # in your site's URL behind the server_url

priority_high
Important

Add this file to .gitignore and don't commit it to your GitHub repo!

Copy your app secrets to the cloud

As the secrets.toml file above is not committed to GitHub, you need to pass its content to your deployed app (on Streamlit Community Cloud) separately. Go to the app dashboard and in the app's dropdown menu, click on Edit Secrets. Copy the content of secrets.toml into the text area. More information is available at Secrets management.

Add tableauserverclient to your requirements file

Add the tableauserverclient package to your requirements.txt file, preferably pinning its version (replace x.x.x with the version you want installed):

# requirements.txt
tableauserverclient==x.x.x

Write your Streamlit app

Copy the code below to your Streamlit app and run it. Note that this code just shows a few options of data you can get ‚Äì explore the tableauserverclient library to find more!

# streamlit_app.py

import streamlit as st
import tableauserverclient as TSC


# Set up connection.
tableau_auth = TSC.PersonalAccessTokenAuth(
    st.secrets["tableau"]["token_name"],
    st.secrets["tableau"]["personal_access_token"],
    st.secrets["tableau"]["site_id"],
)
server = TSC.Server(st.secrets["tableau"]["server_url"], use_server_version=True)


# Get various data.
# Explore the tableauserverclient library for more options.
# Uses st.cache_data to only rerun when the query changes or after 10 min.
@st.cache_data(ttl=600)
def run_query():
    with server.auth.sign_in(tableau_auth):

        # Get all workbooks.
        workbooks, pagination_item = server.workbooks.get()
        workbooks_names = [w.name for w in workbooks]

        # Get views for first workbook.
        server.workbooks.populate_views(workbooks[0])
        views_names = [v.name for v in workbooks[0].views]

        # Get image & CSV for first view of first workbook.
        view_item = workbooks[0].views[0]
        server.views.populate_image(view_item)
        server.views.populate_csv(view_item)
        view_name = view_item.name
        view_image = view_item.image
        # `view_item.csv` is a list of binary objects, convert to str.
        view_csv = b"".join(view_item.csv).decode("utf-8")

        return workbooks_names, views_names, view_name, view_image, view_csv

workbooks_names, views_names, view_name, view_image, view_csv = run_query()


# Print results.
st.subheader("üìì Workbooks")
st.write("Found the following workbooks:", ", ".join(workbooks_names))

st.subheader("üëÅÔ∏è Views")
st.write(
    f"Workbook *{workbooks_names[0]}* has the following views:",
    ", ".join(views_names),
)

st.subheader("üñºÔ∏è Image")
st.write(f"Here's what view *{view_name}* looks like:")
st.image(view_image, width=300)

st.subheader("üìä Data")
st.write(f"And here's the data for view *{view_name}*:")
st.write(pd.read_csv(StringIO(view_csv)))


See st.cache_data above? Without it, Streamlit would run the query every time the app reruns (e.g. on a widget interaction). With st.cache_data, it only runs when the query changes or after 10 minutes (that's what ttl is for). Watch out: If your database updates more frequently, you should adapt ttl or remove caching so viewers always see the latest data. Learn more in Caching.

If everything worked out, your app should look like this (can differ based on your workbooks):

Connect Streamlit to Supabase
Introduction

This guide explains how to securely access a Supabase instance from Streamlit Community Cloud. It uses st.connection, Streamlit Supabase Connector (a community-built connection developed by @SiddhantSadangi) and Streamlit's Secrets management. Supabase is the open source Firebase alternative and is based on PostgreSQL.

push_pin
Note

Community-built connections, such as the Streamlit Supabase Connector, extend and build on the st.connection interface and make it easier than ever to build Streamlit apps with a wide variety of data sources. These type of connections work exactly the same as the ones built into Streamlit and have access to all the same capabilities.

Sign in to Supabase and create a project

First, head over to Supabase and sign up for a free account using your GitHub.

Sign in with GitHub

Authorize Supabase

Once you're signed in, you can create a project.

Your Supabase account

Create a new project

Your screen should look like this once your project has been created:

priority_high
Important

Make sure to note down your Project API Key and Project URL highlighted in the above screenshot. ‚òùÔ∏è

You will need these to connect to your Supabase instance from Streamlit.

Create a Supabase database

Now that you have a project, you can create a database and populate it with some sample data. To do so, click on the SQL editor button on the same project page, followed by the New query button in the SQL editor.

Open the SQL editor

Create a new query

In the SQL editor, enter the following queries to create a database and a table with some example values:

CREATE TABLE mytable (
    name            varchar(80),
    pet             varchar(80)
);

INSERT INTO mytable VALUES ('Mary', 'dog'), ('John', 'cat'), ('Robert', 'bird');


Click Run to execute the queries. To verify that the queries were executed successfully, click on the Table Editor button on the left menu, followed by your newly created table mytable.

Write and run your queries

View your table in the Table Editor

With your Supabase database created, you can now connect to it from Streamlit!

Add Supabase Project URL and API key to your local app secrets

Your local Streamlit app will read secrets from a file .streamlit/secrets.toml in your app's root directory. Create this file if it doesn't exist yet and add the SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_KEY here:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml

[connections.supabase]
SUPABASE_URL = "xxxx"
SUPABASE_KEY = "xxxx"


Replace xxxx above with your Project URL and API key from Step 1.

priority_high
Important

Add this file to .gitignore and don't commit it to your GitHub repo!

Copy your app secrets to the cloud

As the secrets.toml file above is not committed to GitHub, you need to pass its content to your deployed app (on Streamlit Community Cloud) separately. Go to the app dashboard and in the app's dropdown menu, click on Edit Secrets. Copy the content of secrets.toml into the text area. More information is available at Secrets management.

Add st-supabase-connection to your requirements file

Add the st-supabase-connection community-built connection library to your requirements.txt file, preferably pinning its version (replace x.x.x with the version you want installed):

# requirements.txt
st-supabase-connection==x.x.x

star
Tip

We've used the st-supabase-connection library here in combination with st.connection to benefit from the ease of setting up the data connection, managing your credentials, and Streamlit's caching capabilities that native and community-built connections provide.

You can however still directly use the Supabase Python Client Library library if you prefer, but you'll need to write more code to set up the connection and cache the results. See Using the Supabase Python Client Library below for an example.

Write your Streamlit app

Copy the code below to your Streamlit app and run it.

# streamlit_app.py

import streamlit as st
from st_supabase_connection import SupabaseConnection

# Initialize connection.
conn = st.connection("supabase",type=SupabaseConnection)

# Perform query.
rows = conn.query("*", table="mytable", ttl="10m").execute()

# Print results.
for row in rows.data:
    st.write(f"{row['name']} has a :{row['pet']}:")



See st.connection above? This handles secrets retrieval, setup, query caching and retries. By default, query() results are cached without expiring. In this case, we set ttl="10m" to ensure the query result is cached for no longer than 10 minutes. You can also set ttl=0 to disable caching. Learn more in Caching.

If everything worked out (and you used the example table we created above), your app should look like this:

As Supabase uses PostgresSQL under the hood, you can also connect to Supabase by using the connection string Supabase provides under Settings > Databases. From there, you can refer to the PostgresSQL tutorial to connect to your database.

Using the Supabase Python Client Library

If you prefer to use the Supabase Python Client Library directly, you can do so by following the steps below.

Add your Supabase Project URL and API key to your local app secrets:

Your local Streamlit app will read secrets from a file .streamlit/secrets.toml in your app's root directory. Create this file if it doesn't exist yet and add the SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_KEY here:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml

SUPABASE_URL = "xxxx"
SUPABASE_KEY = "xxxx"


Add supabase to your requirements file:

Add the supabase Python Client Library to your requirements.txt file, preferably pinning its version (replace x.x.x with the version you want installed):

# requirements.txt
supabase==x.x.x


Write your Streamlit app:

Copy the code below to your Streamlit app and run it.

# streamlit_app.py

import streamlit as st
from supabase import create_client, Client

# Initialize connection.
# Uses st.cache_resource to only run once.
@st.cache_resource
def init_connection():
    url = st.secrets["SUPABASE_URL"]
    key = st.secrets["SUPABASE_KEY"]
    return create_client(url, key)

supabase = init_connection()

# Perform query.
# Uses st.cache_data to only rerun when the query changes or after 10 min.
@st.cache_data(ttl=600)
def run_query():
    return supabase.table("mytable").select("*").execute()

rows = run_query()

# Print results.
for row in rows.data:
    st.write(f"{row['name']} has a :{row['pet']}:")


See st.cache_data above? Without it, Streamlit would run the query every time the app reruns (e.g. on a widget interaction). With st.cache_data, it only runs when the query changes or after 10 minutes (that's what ttl is for). Watch out: If your database updates more frequently, you should adapt ttl or remove caching so viewers always see the latest data. Learn more in Caching.

Connect Streamlit to a private Google Sheet
Introduction

This guide explains how to securely access a private Google Sheet from Streamlit Community Cloud. It uses st.connection, Streamlit GSheetsConnection, and Streamlit's Secrets management.

If you are fine with enabling link sharing for your Google Sheet (i.e. everyone with the link can view it), the guide Connect Streamlit to a public Google Sheet shows a simpler method of doing this. If your Sheet contains sensitive information and you cannot enable link sharing, keep on reading.

Prerequisites

This tutorial requires streamlit>=1.28 and st-gsheets-connection in your Python environment.

Create a Google Sheet

If you already have a Sheet that you want to use, feel free to skip to the next step.

Create a spreadsheet with this example data.

name	pet
Mary	dog
John	cat
Robert	bird
Enable the Sheets API

Programmatic access to Google Sheets is controlled through Google Cloud Platform. Create an account or sign in and head over to the APIs & Services dashboard (select or create a project if asked). As shown below, search for the Sheets API and enable it:

Create a service account & key file

To use the Sheets API from Streamlit Community Cloud, you need a Google Cloud Platform service account (a special account type for programmatic data access). Go to the Service Accounts page and create an account with the Viewer permission (this will let the account access data but not change it):

push_pin
Note

The button "CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT" is gray, you don't have the correct permissions. Ask the admin of your Google Cloud project for help.

After clicking "DONE", you should be back on the service accounts overview. First, note down the email address of the account you just created (important for next step!). Then, create a JSON key file for the new account and download it:

Share the Google Sheet with the service account

By default, the service account you just created cannot access your Google Sheet. To give it access, click on the "Share" button in the Google Sheet, add the email of the service account (noted down in step 2), and choose the correct permission (if you just want to read the data, "Viewer" is enough):

Add the key file to your local app secrets

Your local Streamlit app will read secrets from a file .streamlit/secrets.toml in your app's root directory. Create this file if it doesn't exist yet and add the URL of your Google Sheet plus the content of the key file you downloaded to it as shown below:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml

[connections.gsheets]
spreadsheet = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/xxxxxxx/edit#gid=0"

# From your JSON key file
type = "service_account"
project_id = "xxx"
private_key_id = "xxx"
private_key = "xxx"
client_email = "xxx"
client_id = "xxx"
auth_uri = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"
token_uri = "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
auth_provider_x509_cert_url = "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs"
client_x509_cert_url = "xxx"

priority_high
Important

Add this file to .gitignore and don't commit it to your GitHub repo!

Write your Streamlit app

Copy the code below to your Streamlit app and run it.

# streamlit_app.py

import streamlit as st
from streamlit_gsheets import GSheetsConnection

# Create a connection object.
conn = st.connection("gsheets", type=GSheetsConnection)

df = conn.read()

# Print results.
for row in df.itertuples():
    st.write(f"{row.name} has a :{row.pet}:")


See st.connection above? This handles secrets retrieval, setup, query caching and retries. By default, .read() results are cached without expiring. You can pass optional parameters to .read() to customize your connection. For example, you can specify the name of a worksheet, cache expiration time, or pass-through parameters for pandas.read_csv like this:

df = conn.read(
    worksheet="Sheet1",
    ttl="10m",
    usecols=[0, 1],
    nrows=3,
)


In this case, we set ttl="10m" to ensure the query result is cached for no longer than 10 minutes. You can also set ttl=0 to disable caching. Learn more in Caching. We've declared optional parameters usecols=[0,1] and nrows=3 for pandas to use under the hood.

If everything worked out (and you used the example table we created above), your app should look like this:

Connecting to a Google Sheet from Community Cloud

This tutorial assumes a local Streamlit app, however you can also connect to Google Sheets from apps hosted in Community Cloud. The main additional steps are:

Include information about dependencies using a requirements.txt file with st-gsheets-connection and any other dependencies.
Add your secrets to your Community Cloud app.

Connect Streamlit to MongoDB
Introduction

This guide explains how to securely access a remote MongoDB database from Streamlit Community Cloud. It uses the PyMongo library and Streamlit's Secrets management.

Create a MongoDB Database
push_pin
Note

If you already have a database that you want to use, feel free to skip to the next step.

First, follow the official tutorials to install MongoDB, set up authentication (note down the username and password!), and connect to the MongoDB instance. Once you are connected, open the mongo shell and enter the following two commands to create a collection with some example values:

use mydb
db.mycollection.insertMany([{"name" : "Mary", "pet": "dog"}, {"name" : "John", "pet": "cat"}, {"name" : "Robert", "pet": "bird"}])

Add username and password to your local app secrets

Your local Streamlit app will read secrets from a file .streamlit/secrets.toml in your app's root directory. Create this file if it doesn't exist yet and add the database information as shown below:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml

[mongo]
host = "localhost"
port = 27017
username = "xxx"
password = "xxx"

priority_high
Important

When copying your app secrets to Streamlit Community Cloud, be sure to replace the values of host, port, username, and password with those of your remote MongoDB database!

Add this file to .gitignore and don't commit it to your GitHub repo!

Copy your app secrets to the cloud

As the secrets.toml file above is not committed to GitHub, you need to pass its content to your deployed app (on Streamlit Community Cloud) separately. Go to the app dashboard and in the app's dropdown menu, click on Edit Secrets. Copy the content of secrets.toml into the text area. More information is available at Secrets management.

Add PyMongo to your requirements file

Add the PyMongo package to your requirements.txt file, preferably pinning its version (replace x.x.x with the version you want installed):

# requirements.txt
pymongo==x.x.x

Write your Streamlit app

Copy the code below to your Streamlit app and run it. Make sure to adapt the name of your database and collection.

# streamlit_app.py

import streamlit as st
import pymongo

# Initialize connection.
# Uses st.cache_resource to only run once.
@st.cache_resource
def init_connection():
    return pymongo.MongoClient(**st.secrets["mongo"])

client = init_connection()

# Pull data from the collection.
# Uses st.cache_data to only rerun when the query changes or after 10 min.
@st.cache_data(ttl=600)
def get_data():
    db = client.mydb
    items = db.mycollection.find()
    items = list(items)  # make hashable for st.cache_data
    return items

items = get_data()

# Print results.
for item in items:
    st.write(f"{item['name']} has a :{item['pet']}:")


See st.cache_data above? Without it, Streamlit would run the query every time the app reruns (e.g. on a widget interaction). With st.cache_data, it only runs when the query changes or after 10 minutes (that's what ttl is for). Watch out: If your database updates more frequently, you should adapt ttl or remove caching so viewers always see the latest data. Learn more in Caching.

If everything worked out (and you used the example data we created above), your app should look like this:

Connect Streamlit to PostgreSQL
Introduction

This guide explains how to securely access a remote PostgreSQL database from Streamlit Community Cloud. It uses st.connection and Streamlit's Secrets management. The below example code will only work on Streamlit version >= 1.28, when st.connection was added.

Create a PostgreSQL database
push_pin
Note

If you already have a database that you want to use, feel free to skip to the next step.

First, follow this tutorial to install PostgreSQL and create a database (note down the database name, username, and password!). Open the SQL Shell (psql) and enter the following two commands to create a table with some example values:

CREATE TABLE mytable (
    name            varchar(80),
    pet             varchar(80)
);

INSERT INTO mytable VALUES ('Mary', 'dog'), ('John', 'cat'), ('Robert', 'bird');

Add username and password to your local app secrets

Your local Streamlit app will read secrets from a file .streamlit/secrets.toml in your app's root directory. Create this file if it doesn't exist yet and add the name, user, and password of your database as shown below:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml

[connections.postgresql]
dialect = "postgresql"
host = "localhost"
port = "5432"
database = "xxx"
username = "xxx"
password = "xxx"

priority_high
Important

When copying your app secrets to Streamlit Community Cloud, be sure to replace the values of host, port, database, username, and password with those of your remote PostgreSQL database!

Add this file to .gitignore and don't commit it to your GitHub repo!

Copy your app secrets to the cloud

As the secrets.toml file above is not committed to GitHub, you need to pass its content to your deployed app (on Streamlit Community Cloud) separately. Go to the app dashboard and in the app's dropdown menu, click on Edit Secrets. Copy the content of secrets.toml into the text area. More information is available at Secrets management.

Add dependencies to your requirements file

Add the psycopg2-binary and SQLAlchemy packages to your requirements.txt file, preferably pinning its version (replace x.x.x with the version you want installed):

# requirements.txt
psycopg2-binary==x.x.x
sqlalchemy==x.x.x

Write your Streamlit app

Copy the code below to your Streamlit app and run it. Make sure to adapt query to use the name of your table.

# streamlit_app.py

import streamlit as st

# Initialize connection.
conn = st.connection("postgresql", type="sql")

# Perform query.
df = conn.query('SELECT * FROM mytable;', ttl="10m")

# Print results.
for row in df.itertuples():
    st.write(f"{row.name} has a :{row.pet}:")


See st.connection above? This handles secrets retrieval, setup, query caching and retries. By default, query() results are cached without expiring. In this case, we set ttl="10m" to ensure the query result is cached for no longer than 10 minutes. You can also set ttl=0 to disable caching. Learn more in Caching.

Connect Streamlit to Google Cloud Storage
Introduction

This guide explains how to securely access files on Google Cloud Storage from Streamlit Community Cloud. It uses Streamlit FilesConnection, the gcsfs library and Streamlit's Secrets management.

Create a Google Cloud Storage bucket and add a file
push_pin
Note

If you already have a bucket that you want to use, feel free to skip to the next step.

First, sign up for Google Cloud Platform or log in. Go to the Google Cloud Storage console and create a new bucket.

Navigate to the upload section of your new bucket:

And upload the following CSV file, which contains some example data:

myfile.csv
Enable the Google Cloud Storage API

The Google Cloud Storage API is enabled by default when you create a project through the Google Cloud Console or CLI. Feel free to skip to the next step.

If you do need to enable the API for programmatic access in your project, head over to the APIs & Services dashboard (select or create a project if asked). Search for the Cloud Storage API and enable it. The screenshot below has a blue "Manage" button and indicates the "API is enabled" which means no further action needs to be taken. This is very likely what you have since the API is enabled by default. However, if that is not what you see and you have an "Enable" button, you'll need to enable the API:

Create a service account and key file

To use the Google Cloud Storage API from Streamlit, you need a Google Cloud Platform service account (a special type for programmatic data access). Go to the Service Accounts page and create an account with Viewer permission.

push_pin
Note

If the button CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT is gray, you don't have the correct permissions. Ask the admin of your Google Cloud project for help.

After clicking DONE, you should be back on the service accounts overview. Create a JSON key file for the new account and download it:

Add the key to your local app secrets

Your local Streamlit app will read secrets from a file .streamlit/secrets.toml in your app's root directory. Create this file if it doesn't exist yet and add the access key to it as shown below:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml

[connections.gcs]
type = "service_account"
project_id = "xxx"
private_key_id = "xxx"
private_key = "xxx"
client_email = "xxx"
client_id = "xxx"
auth_uri = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"
token_uri = "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
auth_provider_x509_cert_url = "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs"
client_x509_cert_url = "xxx"

priority_high
Important

Add this file to .gitignore and don't commit it to your GitHub repo!

Copy your app secrets to the cloud

As the secrets.toml file above is not committed to GitHub, you need to pass its content to your deployed app (on Streamlit Community Cloud) separately. Go to the app dashboard and in the app's dropdown menu, click on Edit Secrets. Copy the content of secrets.toml into the text area. More information is available at Secrets management.

Add FilesConnection and gcsfs to your requirements file

Add the FilesConnection and gcsfs packages to your requirements.txt file, preferably pinning the versions (replace x.x.x with the version you want installed):

# requirements.txt
gcsfs==x.x.x
st-files-connection

Write your Streamlit app

Copy the code below to your Streamlit app and run it. Make sure to adapt the name of your bucket and file. Note that Streamlit automatically turns the access keys from your secrets file into environment variables.

# streamlit_app.py

import streamlit as st
from st_files_connection import FilesConnection

# Create connection object and retrieve file contents.
# Specify input format is a csv and to cache the result for 600 seconds.
conn = st.connection('gcs', type=FilesConnection)
df = conn.read("streamlit-bucket/myfile.csv", input_format="csv", ttl=600)

# Print results.
for row in df.itertuples():
    st.write(f"{row.Owner} has a :{row.Pet}:")


See st.connection above? This handles secrets retrieval, setup, result caching and retries. By default, read() results are cached without expiring. In this case, we set ttl=600 to ensure the file contents is cached for no longer than 10 minutes. You can also set ttl=0 to disable caching. Learn more in Caching.

If everything worked out (and you used the example file given above), your app should look like this:

Share your app
Share your app

Now that your app is deployed you can easily share it and collaborate on it. But first, let's take a moment and do a little joy dance for getting that app deployed! üï∫üíÉ

Your app is now live at a fixed URL, so go wild and share it with whomever you want. Your app will inherit permissions from your GitHub repo, meaning that if your repo is private your app will be private and if your repo is public your app will be public. If you want to change that you can simply do so from the app settings menu.

You are only allowed one private app at a time. If you've deployed from a private repository, you will have to make that app public or delete it before you can deploy another app from a private repository. Only developers can change your app between public and private.

Make your app public or private
Share your public app
Share your private app
Make your app public or private

If you deployed your app from a public repository, your app will be public by default. If you deployed your app from a private repository, you will need to make the app public if you want to freely share it with the community at large.

Set privacy from your app settings

Access your App settings and go to the "Sharing" section.

Set your app's privacy under "Who can view this app." Select "This app is public and searchable" to make your app public. Select "Only specific people can view this app" to make your app private.

Set privacy from the share button

From your app at <your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app, click "Share" in the upper-right corner.

Toggle your app between public and private by clicking "Make this app public".

Share your public app

Once your app is public, just give anyone your app's URL and they view it! Streamlit Community Cloud has several convenient shortcuts for sharing your app.

Share your app on social media

From your app at <your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app, click "Share" in the upper-right corner.

Click "Social" to access convenient social media share buttons.

star
Tip

Use the social media sharing buttons to post your app on our forum! We'd love to see what you make and perhaps feature your app as our app of the month. üíñ

Invite viewers by email

Whether your app is public or private, you can send an email invite to your app directly from Streamlit Community Cloud. This grants the viewer access to analytics for all your public apps and the ability to invite other viewers to your workspace. Developers and invited viewers are identified by their email in analytics instead of appearing anonymously (if they view any of your apps while logged in). Read more about viewers in App analytics.

From your app at <your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app, click "Share" in the upper-right corner.

Enter an email address and click "Invite".

Invited users will get a direct link to your app in their inbox.

Copy your app's URL

You can convenitiently copy your app's URL from the share menu or from your workspace.

From your app click "Share" in the upper-right corner then click "Copy link".

From your workspace click the overflow menu icon (more_vert) then click "Copy URL".

Add a badge to your GitHub repository

To help others find and play with your Streamlit app, you can add Streamlit's GitHub badge to your repo. Below is an enlarged example of what the badge looks like. Clicking on the badge takes you to‚Äîin this case‚ÄîStreamlit's Roadmap.

Once you deploy your app, you can embed this badge right into your GitHub README.md by adding the following Markdown:

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://<your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app)

push_pin
Note

Be sure to replace https://<your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app with the URL of your deployed app!

Share your private app

By default an app deployed from a private repository will be private to the developers in the workspace. A private app will not be visible to anyone else unless you grant them explicit permission. You can grant permission by adding them as a developer on GitHub or by adding them as a viewer on Streamlit Community Cloud.

Once you have added someone's email address to your app's viewer list, that person will be able to sign in and view your private app. If their email is associated to a Google account, they will be able to sign in with Google OAuth. Otherwise, they will be able to sign in with single-use, emailed links. Streamlit sends an email invitation with a link to your app every time you invite someone.

priority_high
Important

When you add a viewer to any app in your workspace, they are granted access to analytics for that app as well as analytics for all your public apps. They can also pass these permissions to others by inviting more viewers. All viewers and developers in your workspace are identified by their email in analytics. Furthermore, their emails show in analytics for every app in your workspace and not just apps they are explicitly invited to. Read more about viewers in App analytics

Invite viewers from the share button

From your app at <your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app, click "Share" in the upper-right corner.

Enter the email to send an invitation to and click "Invite".

Invited users appear in the list below.

Invited users will get a direct link to your app in their inbox.

To remove a viewer, simply access the share menu as above and click the close next to their name.

Invite viewers from your app settings

Access your App settings and go to the "Sharing" section.

Add or remove users from the list of viewers. Click "Save".

Static file serving
Static file serving

Streamlit apps can host and serve small, static media files to support media embedding use cases that won't work with the normal media elements.

To enable this feature, set enableStaticServing = true under [server] in your config file, or environment variable STREAMLIT_SERVER_ENABLE_STATIC_SERVING=true.

Media stored in the folder ./static/ relative to the running app file is served at path app/static/[filename], such as http://localhost:8501/app/static/cat.png.

Details on usage
Files with the following extensions will be served normally: ".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".gif". Any other file will be sent with header Content-Type:text/plain which will cause browsers to render in plain text. This is included for security - other file types that need to render should be hosted outside the app.
Streamlit also sets X-Content-Type-Options:nosniff for all files rendered from the static directory.
For apps running on Streamlit Community Cloud:
Files available in the Github repo will always be served. Any files generated while the app is running, such as based on user interaction (file upload, etc), are not guaranteed to persist across user sessions.
Apps which store and serve many files, or large files, may run into resource limits and be shut down.
Example usage
Put an image cat.png in the folder ./static/
Add enableStaticServing = true under [server] in your .streamlit/config.toml
Any media in the ./static/ folder is served at the relative URL like app/static/cat.png
# .streamlit/config.toml

[server]
enableStaticServing = true

# app.py
import streamlit as st

with st.echo():
    st.title("CAT")

    st.markdown("[![Click me](app/static/cat.png)](https://streamlit.io)")

Deploy Streamlit using Kubernetes
Introduction

So you have an amazing app and you want to start sharing it with other people, what do you do? You have a few options. First, where do you want to run your Streamlit app, and how do you want to access it?

On your corporate network¬†- Most corporate networks are closed to the outside world. You typically use a VPN to log onto your corporate network and access resources there. You could run your Streamlit app on a server in your corporate network for security reasons, to ensure that only folks internal to your company can access it.
On the cloud¬†- If you'd like to access your Streamlit app from outside of a corporate network, or share your app with folks outside of your home network or laptop, you might choose this option. In this case, it'll depend on your hosting provider. We have community-submitted guides from Heroku, AWS, and other providers.

Wherever you decide to deploy your app, you will first need to containerize it. This guide walks you through using Kubernetes to deploy your app. If you prefer Docker see Deploy Streamlit using Docker.

Prerequisites
Install Docker Engine
Install the gcloud CLI
Install Docker Engine

If you haven't already done so, install Docker on your server. Docker provides¬†.deb and¬†.rpm packages from many Linux distributions, including:

Debian
Ubuntu

Verify that Docker Engine is installed correctly by running the¬†hello-world Docker image:

sudo docker run hello-world

star
Tip

Follow Docker's official post-installation steps for Linux to run Docker as a non-root user, so that you don't have to preface the docker command with sudo.

Install the gcloud CLI

In this guide, we will orchestrate Docker containers with Kubernetes and host docker images on the Google Container Registry (GCR). As GCR is a Google-supported Docker registry, we need to register¬†gcloud as the Docker credential helper.

Follow the official documentation to Install the gcloud CLI and initialize it.

Create a Docker container

We need to create a docker container which contains all the dependencies and the application code. Below you can see the entrypoint, i.e. the command run when the container starts, and the Dockerfile definition.

Create an entrypoint script

Create a run.sh script containing the following:

#!/bin/bash

APP_PID=
stopRunningProcess() {
    # Based on https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-propagate-a-signal-to-child-processes-from-a-bash-script
    if test ! "${APP_PID}" = '' && ps -p ${APP_PID} > /dev/null ; then
       > /proc/1/fd/1 echo "Stopping ${COMMAND_PATH} which is running with process ID ${APP_PID}"

       kill -TERM ${APP_PID}
       > /proc/1/fd/1 echo "Waiting for ${COMMAND_PATH} to process SIGTERM signal"

        wait ${APP_PID}
        > /proc/1/fd/1 echo "All processes have stopped running"
    else
        > /proc/1/fd/1 echo "${COMMAND_PATH} was not started when the signal was sent or it has already been stopped"
    fi
}

trap stopRunningProcess EXIT TERM

source ${VIRTUAL_ENV}/bin/activate

streamlit run ${HOME}/app/streamlit_app.py &
APP_ID=${!}

wait ${APP_ID}

Create a Dockerfile

Docker builds images by reading the instructions from a¬†Dockerfile. A¬†Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Learn more in the Dockerfile reference. The¬†docker build command builds an image from a¬†Dockerfile. The docker run command first creates a container over the specified image, and then starts it using the specified command.

Here's an example Dockerfile that you can add to the root of your directory.

FROM python:3.8-slim

RUN groupadd --gid 1000 appuser \
    && useradd --uid 1000 --gid 1000 -ms /bin/bash appuser

RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir --upgrade \
    pip \
    virtualenv

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    software-properties-common \
    git

USER appuser

priority_high
Important

As mentioned in Development flow, for Streamlit version 1.10.0 and higher, Streamlit apps cannot be run from the root directory of Linux distributions. Your main script should live in a directory other than the root directory. If you try to run a Streamlit app from the root directory, Streamlit will throw a FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory error. For more information, see GitHub issue #5239.

If you are using Streamlit version 1.10.0 or higher, you must set the WORKDIR to a directory other than the root directory. For example, you can set the WORKDIR to /home/appuser as shown in the example Dockerfile above.

Build a Docker image

Put the above files (run.sh and Dockerfile) in the same folder and build the docker image:

docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT_ID/k8s-streamlit:test .

priority_high
Important

Replace $GCP_PROJECT_ID in the above command with the name of your Google Cloud project.

Upload the Docker image to a container registry

The next step is to upload the Docker image to a container registry. In this example, we will use the Google Container Registry (GCR). Start by enabling the Container Registry API. Sign in to Google Cloud and navigate to your project‚Äôs Container Registry and click Enable.

We can now build the Docker image from the previous step and push it to our project‚Äôs GCR. Be sure to replace $GCP_PROJECT_ID in the docker push command with the name of your project:

gcloud auth configure-docker
docker push gcr.io/$GCP_PROJECT_ID/k8s-streamlit:test

Create a Kubernetes deployment

For this step you will need a:

Running Kubernetes service
Custom domain for which you can generate a TLS certificate
DNS service where you can configure your custom domain to point to the application IP

As the image was uploaded to the container registry in the previous step, we can run it in Kubernetes using the below configurations.

Install and run Kubernetes

Make sure your Kubernetes client, kubectl, is installed and running on your machine.

Configure a Google OAuth Client and oauth2-proxy

For configuring the Google OAuth Client, please see Google Auth Provider. Configure oauth2-proxy to use the desired OAuth Provider Configuration and update the oath2-proxy config in the config map.

The below configuration contains a ouath2-proxy sidecar container which handles the authentication with Google. You can learn more from the oauth2-proxy repository.

Create a Kubernetes configuration file

Create a YAML configuration file named k8s-streamlit.yaml:

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: streamlit-configmap
data:
  oauth2-proxy.cfg: |-
    http_address = "0.0.0.0:4180"
    upstreams = ["http://127.0.0.1:8501/"]
    email_domains = ["*"]
    client_id = "<GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>"
    client_secret = "<GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET>"
    cookie_secret = "<16, 24, or 32 bytes>"
    redirect_url = <REDIRECT_URL>

Important

While the above configurations can be copied verbatim, you will have to configure the oauth2-proxy yourself and use the correct GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GCP_PROJECT_ID, and REDIRECT_URL.

Now create the configuration from the file in Kubernetes with the kubectl create command:

kubctl create -f k8s-streamlit.yaml

Set up TLS support

Since you are using the Google authentication, you will need to set up TLS support. Find out how in TLS Configuration.

Verify the deployment

Once the deployment and the service are created, we need to wait a couple of minutes for the public IP address to become available. We can check when that is ready by running:

kubectl get service streamlit-service -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'


After the public IP is assigned, you will need to configure in your DNS service an A record pointing to the above IP address.

Create your account
Create your account

Before you can start deploying apps for the world to see, you need to sign up for your Streamlit Community Cloud account.

Streamlit Community Cloud accounts have two underlying identities: primary and source control. Your primary identity is used for viewing analytics as well as viewing permissions. Your source-control identity is used for deploying and managing apps.

Sign up

Although you can begin the sign-up process with GitHub, we recommend starting with Google or email in order to have a complete account from the start.

Step 1: Primary identity (Google or email)
Step 2: Source control (GitHub)
Step 3: Set up your account
Step 1: Primary identity

Your primary identity is associated to an email. You can sign in through Google or through single-use, emailed links which are valid for 15 minutes once requested.

If you're sharing a private app, you will assign viewing permission by email. Therefore, your app's users will need to sign in with either Google or emailed links.

Primary identity option 1: Google
Go to share.streamlit.io/signup.
Click "Continue with Google".
Enter your Google credentials and click "Next".
If you will be deploying or managing any apps, click "Connect GitHub account" and proceed to Step 2: Source Control. If you are only going to be viewing apps and will not be using GitHub, you can click "Skip this step" and proceed to Step 3: Set up your account.
Primary identity option 2: email
Go to share.streamlit.io/signup.
Enter your email address and click "Continue with email".
A confirmation screen will display, telling you to check your email.
Check your inbox for an email with the subject "Sign in to Streamlit Cloud". Click the link to sign in.
If you will be deploying or managing any apps, click "Connect GitHub account" and proceed to Step 2: Source control. If you are only going to be viewing apps and will not be using GitHub, you can click "Skip this step" and proceed to Step 3: Set up your account.
Step 2: Source control

Streamlit Community Cloud is integrated with GitHub for source control. If you begin your sign-up process with GitHub, you will not be directly prompted to create a primary identity. However, you can attach a Google account later.

There are two different authorization requests to completely Connect your GitHub account. You will encounter the first authorization request when you begin connecting your GitHub account. A second authorization is needed the first time you deploy an app. If you will be deploying or managing any apps from a GitHub organization, your authorization requests will include additional options to allow Organization access.

After completing Step 1: Primary identity or after clicking "Continue with GitHub" from the sign-up page, enter your GitHub credentials and click "Sign in".
Click "Authorize streamlit".
Continue to Step 3: Set up your account
Step 3: Set up your account

As a final step to account creation, please tell us about yourself and your experience with Streamlit. This is also when you can read and acknowledge our Terms of use and Privacy notice. The email you provide in this survey is not used as your account email.

Fill in your information and click "Continue" at the bottom of the screen.
You will be taken to your workspace.
Finish up

Congratulations on creating your Streamlit Community Cloud account! A warning icon (warning) next to "Settings" in the upper-right corner is expected; this indicates one of three things:

You created a primary identity and skipped connecting GitHub.
You started with GitHub and did not create a primary identity.
You created both a primary identity and connected GitHub, but the second authorization for GitHub is still pending. You will be prompted with the second authorization when you deploy your first app.
What's next?

Now that you have your account you can Explore your workspace. Or if you're ready to go, jump right in and Deploy your app.

Connect Streamlit to a public Google Sheet
Introduction

This guide explains how to securely access a public Google Sheet from Streamlit. It uses st.connection, Streamlit GSheetsConnection, and Streamlit's Secrets management.

This method requires you to enable link sharing for your Google Sheet. While the sharing link will not appear in your code (and actually acts as sort of a password!), someone with the link can get all the data in the Sheet. If you don't want this, follow the (more complicated) guide to Connect Streamlit to a private Google Sheet.

Prerequisites

This tutorial requires streamlit>=1.28 and st-gsheets-connection in your Python environment.

Create a Google Sheet and turn on link sharing

If you already have a Sheet that you want to access, feel free to skip to the next step. See Google's documentation on how to share spreadsheets for more information.

Create a spreadsheet with this example data and create a share link. The link should have "Anyone with the link" set as a "Viewer."

name	pet
Mary	dog
John	cat
Robert	bird
Add the Sheets URL to your local app secrets

Your local Streamlit app will read secrets from a file .streamlit/secrets.toml in your app's root directory. Create this file if it doesn't exist yet and add the share link of your Google Sheet to it as shown below:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml
[connections.gsheets]
spreadsheet = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/xxxxxxx/edit#gid=0"

priority_high
Important

Add this file to .gitignore and don't commit it to your GitHub repo!

Write your Streamlit app

Copy the code below to your Streamlit app and run it.

# streamlit_app.py

import streamlit as st
from streamlit_gsheets import GSheetsConnection

# Create a connection object.
conn = st.connection("gsheets", type=GSheetsConnection)

df = conn.read()

# Print results.
for row in df.itertuples():
    st.write(f"{row.name} has a :{row.pet}:")


See st.connection above? This handles secrets retrieval, setup, query caching and retries. By default, .read() results are cached without expiring. You can pass optional parameters to .read() to customize your connection. For example, you can specify the name of a worksheet, cache expiration time, or pass-through parameters for pandas.read_csv like this:

df = conn.read(
    worksheet="Sheet1",
    ttl="10m",
    usecols=[0, 1],
    nrows=3,
)


In this case, we set ttl="10m" to ensure the query result is cached for no longer than 10 minutes. You can also set ttl=0 to disable caching. Learn more in Caching. We've declared optional parameters usecols=[0,1] and nrows=3 for pandas to use under the hood.

If everything worked out (and you used the example table we created above), your app should look like this:

Connecting to a Google Sheet from Community Cloud

This tutorial assumes a local Streamlit app, however you can also connect to Google Sheets from apps hosted in Community Cloud. The main additional steps are:

Include information about dependencies using a requirements.txt file with st-gsheets-connection and any other dependencies.
Add your secrets to your Community Cloud app.

Microsoft SQL Server
Connect Streamlit to Microsoft SQL Server
Introduction

This guide explains how to securely access a remote Microsoft SQL Server database from Streamlit Community Cloud. It uses the pyodbc library and Streamlit's Secrets management.

Create an SQL Server database
push_pin
Note

If you already have a remote database that you want to use, feel free to skip to the next step.

First, follow the Microsoft documentation to install SQL Server and the sqlcmd Utility. They have detailed installation guides on how to:

Install SQL Server on Windows
Install on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
Install on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
Install on Ubuntu
Run on Docker
Provision a SQL VM in Azure

Once you have SQL Server installed, note down your SQL Server name, username, and password during setup.

Connect locally

If you are connecting locally, use sqlcmd to connect to your new local SQL Server instance.

In your terminal, run the following command:

sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA -P '<YourPassword>'


As you are connecting locally, the SQL Server name is localhost, the username is SA, and the password is the one you provided during the SA account setup.

You should see a sqlcmd command prompt 1>, if successful.

If you run into a connection failure, review Microsoft's connection troubleshooting recommendations for your OS (Linux & Windows).

star
Tip

When connecting remotely, the SQL Server name is the machine name or IP address. You might also need to open the SQL Server TCP port (default 1433) on your firewall.

Create a SQL Server database

By now, you have SQL Server running and have connected to it with sqlcmd! ü•≥ Let's put it to use by creating a database containing a table with some example values.

From the sqlcmd command prompt, run the following Transact-SQL command to create a test database mydb:

CREATE DATABASE mydb


To execute the above command, type GO on a new line:

GO

Insert some data

Next create a new table, mytable, in the mydb database with three columns and two rows.

Switch to the new mydb database:

USE mydb


Create a new table with the following schema:

CREATE TABLE mytable (name varchar(80), pet varchar(80))


Insert some data into the table:

INSERT INTO mytable VALUES ('Mary', 'dog'), ('John', 'cat'), ('Robert', 'bird')


Type GO to execute the above commands:

GO


To end your sqlcmd session, type QUIT on a new line.

Add username and password to your local app secrets

Your local Streamlit app will read secrets from a file .streamlit/secrets.toml in your app's root directory. Create this file if it doesn't exist yet and add the SQL Server name, database name, username, and password as shown below:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml

server = "localhost"
database = "mydb"
username = "SA"
password = "xxx"

priority_high
Important

When copying your app secrets to Streamlit Community Cloud, be sure to replace the values of server, database, username, and password with those of your remote SQL Server!

And add this file to .gitignore and don't commit it to your GitHub repo.

Copy your app secrets to Streamlit Community Cloud

As the secrets.toml file above is not committed to GitHub, you need to pass its content to your deployed app (on Streamlit Community Cloud) separately. Go to the app dashboard and in the app's dropdown menu, click on Edit Secrets. Copy the content of secrets.toml into the text area. More information is available at Secrets management.

Add pyodbc to your requirements file

To connect to SQL Server locally with Streamlit, you need to pip install pyodbc, in addition to the Microsoft ODBC driver you installed during the SQL Server installation.

On Streamlit Cloud, we have built-in support for SQL Server. On popular demand, we directly added SQL Server tools including the ODBC drivers and the executables sqlcmd and bcp to the container image for Cloud apps, so you don't need to install them.

All you need to do is add the pyodbc Python package to your requirements.txt file, and you're ready to go! üéà

# requirements.txt
pyodbc==x.x.x


Replace x.x.x ‚òùÔ∏è with the version of pyodbc you want installed on Cloud.

push_pin
Note

At this time, Streamlit Community Cloud does not support Azure Active Directory authentication. We will update this tutorial when we add support for Azure Active Directory.

Write your Streamlit app

Copy the code below to your Streamlit app and run it. Make sure to adapt query to use the name of your table.

import streamlit as st
import pyodbc

# Initialize connection.
# Uses st.cache_resource to only run once.
@st.cache_resource
def init_connection():
    return pyodbc.connect(
        "DRIVER={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};SERVER="
        + st.secrets["server"]
        + ";DATABASE="
        + st.secrets["database"]
        + ";UID="
        + st.secrets["username"]
        + ";PWD="
        + st.secrets["password"]
    )

conn = init_connection()

# Perform query.
# Uses st.cache_data to only rerun when the query changes or after 10 min.
@st.cache_data(ttl=600)
def run_query(query):
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute(query)
        return cur.fetchall()

rows = run_query("SELECT * from mytable;")

# Print results.
for row in rows:
    st.write(f"{row[0]} has a :{row[1]}:")



See st.cache_data above? Without it, Streamlit would run the query every time the app reruns (e.g. on a widget interaction). With st.cache_data, it only runs when the query changes or after 10 minutes (that's what ttl is for). Watch out: If your database updates more frequently, you should adapt ttl or remove caching so viewers always see the latest data. Learn more in Caching.

If everything worked out (and you used the example table we created above), your app should look like this:

Connect Streamlit to Deta Base
Introduction

This guide explains how to securely access and write to a Deta Base database from Streamlit Community Cloud. Deta Base is a fully-managed and fast NoSQL database with a focus on end-user simplicity. The data is stored in your own "personal cloud" on Deta Space. This guide uses the Deta Python SDK for Deta Base and Streamlit's Secrets management.

Create an account and sign in to Deta Space

First, you need to create a Deta Space account for using Deta Base. Make sure the "Developer Mode" option is enabled when signing up. Once you have an account, sign in to Deta Space. After signing in, open the Collections app by clicking on it.

Deta Collections is a pre-installed app on Space that stores different types of data that can be connected to other apps or services.

Deta Space Canvas

Now click on the Get Started button and then click on the Create Collection button after giving your Collection a name.

Create a New Collection

After that, click on the Collection Settings option in the top corner, which will show the modal for creating a Data Key. Click on the Create New Data Key button, then give your key a name, and click the Generate button. Copy the key shown to your clipboard by clicking on the copy button.

Data Keys allow you to read and manipulate data within your Collections.

Generate Data Key

Be sure to store your Data Key securely. It is shown only once, and you will need it to connect to your Deta Base.

Add Data Key to your local app secrets

Your local Streamlit app will read secrets from a file .streamlit/secrets.toml in your app's root directory. Create this file if it doesn't exist yet and add the Data Key (from the previous step) of your Deta Base as shown below:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml
data_key = "xxx"


Replace xxx above ‚òùÔ∏è with your Data Key from the previous step.

priority_high
Important

Add this file to .gitignore and don't commit it to your GitHub repo!

Copy your app secrets to the cloud

As the secrets.toml file above is not committed to GitHub, you need to pass its content to your deployed app (on Streamlit Community Cloud) separately. Go to the app dashboard and in the app's dropdown menu, click on Edit Secrets. Copy the content of secrets.toml into the text area. More information is available at Secrets management.

Add deta to your requirements file

Add the deta Python SDK for Deta Base to your requirements.txt file, preferably pinning its version (replace x.x.x with the version you want installed):

# requirements.txt
deta==x.x.x

Write your Streamlit app

Copy the code below to your Streamlit app and run it. The example app below writes data from a Streamlit form to a Deta Base database example-db.

import streamlit as st
from deta import Deta

# Data to be written to Deta Base
with st.form("form"):
    name = st.text_input("Your name")
    age = st.number_input("Your age")
    submitted = st.form_submit_button("Store in database")


# Connect to Deta Base with your Data Key
deta = Deta(st.secrets["data_key"])

# Create a new database "example-db"
# If you need a new database, just use another name.
db = deta.Base("example-db")

# If the user clicked the submit button,
# write the data from the form to the database.
# You can store any data you want here. Just modify that dictionary below (the entries between the {}).
if submitted:
    db.put({"name": name, "age": age})

"---"
"Here's everything stored in the database:"
# This reads all items from the database and displays them to your app.
# db_content is a list of dictionaries. You can do everything you want with it.
db_content = db.fetch().items
st.write(db_content)


If everything worked out (and you used the example we created above), your app should look like this:

Connect Streamlit to Google BigQuery
Introduction

This guide explains how to securely access a BigQuery database from Streamlit Community Cloud. It uses the google-cloud-bigquery library and Streamlit's Secrets management.

Create a BigQuery database
push_pin
Note

If you already have a database that you want to use, feel free to skip to the next step.

For this example, we will use one of the sample datasets from BigQuery (namely the shakespeare table). If you want to create a new dataset instead, follow Google's quickstart guide.

Enable the BigQuery API

Programmatic access to BigQuery is controlled through Google Cloud Platform. Create an account or sign in and head over to the APIs & Services dashboard (select or create a project if asked). As shown below, search for the BigQuery API and enable it:

Create a service account & key file

To use the BigQuery API from Streamlit Community Cloud, you need a Google Cloud Platform service account (a special account type for programmatic data access). Go to the Service Accounts page and create an account with the Viewer permission (this will let the account access data but not change it):

push_pin
Note

If the button CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT is gray, you don't have the correct permissions. Ask the admin of your Google Cloud project for help.

After clicking DONE, you should be back on the service accounts overview. Create a JSON key file for the new account and download it:

Add the key file to your local app secrets

Your local Streamlit app will read secrets from a file .streamlit/secrets.toml in your app's root directory. Create this file if it doesn't exist yet and add the content of the key file you just downloaded to it as shown below:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml

[gcp_service_account]
type = "service_account"
project_id = "xxx"
private_key_id = "xxx"
private_key = "xxx"
client_email = "xxx"
client_id = "xxx"
auth_uri = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"
token_uri = "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
auth_provider_x509_cert_url = "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs"
client_x509_cert_url = "xxx"

priority_high
Important

Add this file to .gitignore and don't commit it to your GitHub repo!

Copy your app secrets to the cloud

As the secrets.toml file above is not committed to GitHub, you need to pass its content to your deployed app (on Streamlit Community Cloud) separately. Go to the app dashboard and in the app's dropdown menu, click on Edit Secrets. Copy the content of secrets.toml into the text area. More information is available at Secrets management.

Add google-cloud-bigquery to your requirements file

Add the google-cloud-bigquery package to your requirements.txt file, preferably pinning its version (replace x.x.x with the version want installed):

# requirements.txt
google-cloud-bigquery==x.x.x

Write your Streamlit app

Copy the code below to your Streamlit app and run it. Make sure to adapt the query if you don't use the sample table.

# streamlit_app.py

import streamlit as st
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from google.cloud import bigquery

# Create API client.
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_info(
    st.secrets["gcp_service_account"]
)
client = bigquery.Client(credentials=credentials)

# Perform query.
# Uses st.cache_data to only rerun when the query changes or after 10 min.
@st.cache_data(ttl=600)
def run_query(query):
    query_job = client.query(query)
    rows_raw = query_job.result()
    # Convert to list of dicts. Required for st.cache_data to hash the return value.
    rows = [dict(row) for row in rows_raw]
    return rows

rows = run_query("SELECT word FROM `bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare` LIMIT 10")

# Print results.
st.write("Some wise words from Shakespeare:")
for row in rows:
    st.write("‚úçÔ∏è " + row['word'])


See st.cache_data above? Without it, Streamlit would run the query every time the app reruns (e.g. on a widget interaction). With st.cache_data, it only runs when the query changes or after 10 minutes (that's what ttl is for). Watch out: If your database updates more frequently, you should adapt ttl or remove caching so viewers always see the latest data. Learn more in Caching.

Alternatively, you can use pandas to read from BigQuery right into a dataframe! Follow all the above steps, install the pandas-gbq library (don't forget to add it to requirements.txt!), and call pandas.read_gbq(query, credentials=credentials). More info in the pandas docs.

If everything worked out (and you used the sample table), your app should look like this:

Connect Streamlit to AWS S3
Introduction

This guide explains how to securely access files on AWS S3 from Streamlit Community Cloud. It uses Streamlit FilesConnection, the s3fs library and optionally Streamlit's Secrets management.

Create an S3 bucket and add a file
push_pin
Note

If you already have a bucket that you want to use, feel free to skip to the next step.

First, sign up for AWS or log in. Go to the S3 console and create a new bucket:

Navigate to the upload section of your new bucket:

And note down the "AWS Region" for later. In this example, it's us-east-1, but it may differ for you.

Next, upload the following CSV file, which contains some example data:

myfile.csv
Create access keys

Go to the AWS console, create access keys as shown below and copy the "Access Key ID" and "Secret Access Key":

star
Tip

Access keys created as a root user have wide-ranging permissions. In order to make your AWS account more secure, you should consider creating an IAM account with restricted permissions and using its access keys. More information here.

Set up your AWS credentials locally

Streamlit FilesConnection and s3fs will read and use your existing AWS credentials and configuration if available - such as from an ~/.aws/credentials file or environment variables.

If you don't already have this set up, or plan to host the app on Streamlit Community Cloud, you should specify the credentials from a file .streamlit/secrets.toml in your app's root directory or your home directory. Create this file if it doesn't exist yet and add to it the access key ID, access key secret, and the AWS default region you noted down earlier, as shown below:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "xxx"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "xxx"
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION = "xxx"

priority_high
Important

Be sure to replace xxx above with the values you noted down earlier, and add this file to .gitignore so you don't commit it to your GitHub repo!

Copy your app secrets to the cloud

To host your app on Streamlit Community Cloud, you will need to pass your credentials to your deployed app via secrets. Go to the app dashboard and in the app's dropdown menu, click on Edit Secrets. Copy the content of secrets.toml above into the text area. More information is available at Secrets management.

Add FilesConnection and s3fs to your requirements file

Add the FilesConnection and s3fs packages to your requirements.txt file, preferably pinning the versions (replace x.x.x with the version you want installed):

# requirements.txt
s3fs==x.x.x
st-files-connection

Write your Streamlit app

Copy the code below to your Streamlit app and run it. Make sure to adapt the name of your bucket and file. Note that Streamlit automatically turns the access keys from your secrets file into environment variables, where s3fs searches for them by default.

# streamlit_app.py

import streamlit as st
from st_files_connection import FilesConnection

# Create connection object and retrieve file contents.
# Specify input format is a csv and to cache the result for 600 seconds.
conn = st.connection('s3', type=FilesConnection)
df = conn.read("testbucket-jrieke/myfile.csv", input_format="csv", ttl=600)

# Print results.
for row in df.itertuples():
    st.write(f"{row.Owner} has a :{row.Pet}:")


See st.connection above? This handles secrets retrieval, setup, result caching and retries. By default, read() results are cached without expiring. In this case, we set ttl=600 to ensure the file contents is cached for no longer than 10 minutes. You can also set ttl=0 to disable caching. Learn more in Caching.

If everything worked out (and you used the example file given above), your app should look like this:

Deprecation notice

st.experimental_data_editor was deprecated in version 1.23.0. Use st.data_editor instead.

Display a data editor widget.

The data editor widget allows you to edit dataframes and many other data structures in a table-like UI.

Warning

When going from st.experimental_data_editor to st.data_editor in 1.23.0, the data editor's representation in st.session_state was changed. The edited_cells dictionary is now called edited_rows and uses a different format ({0: {"column name": "edited value"}} instead of {"0:1": "edited value"}). You may need to adjust the code if your app uses st.experimental_data_editor in combination with st.session_state."

Function signature
[source]

st.experimental_data_editor(data, *, width=None, height=None, use_container_width=False, hide_index=None, column_order=None, column_config=None, num_rows="fixed", disabled=False, key=None, on_change=None, args=None, kwargs=None)

Parameters

data (pandas.DataFrame, pandas.Series, pandas.Styler, pandas.Index, pyarrow.Table, numpy.ndarray, pyspark.sql.DataFrame, snowflake.snowpark.DataFrame, list, set, tuple, dict, or None)

The data to edit in the data editor.

Note

Styles from pandas.Styler will only be applied to non-editable columns.
Mixing data types within a column can make the column uneditable.
Additionally, the following data types are not yet supported for editing: complex, list, tuple, bytes, bytearray, memoryview, dict, set, frozenset, fractions.Fraction, pandas.Interval, and pandas.Period.
To prevent overflow in JavaScript, columns containing datetime.timedelta and pandas.Timedelta values will default to uneditable but this can be changed through column configuration.

width (int or None)

Desired width of the data editor expressed in pixels. If None, the width will be automatically determined.

height (int or None)

Desired height of the data editor expressed in pixels. If None, the height will be automatically determined.

use_container_width (bool)

If True, set the data editor width to the width of the parent container. This takes precedence over the width argument. Defaults to False.

hide_index (bool or None)

Whether to hide the index column(s). If None (default), the visibility of index columns is automatically determined based on the data.

column_order (Iterable of str or None)

Specifies the display order of columns. This also affects which columns are visible. For example, column_order=("col2", "col1") will display 'col2' first, followed by 'col1', and will hide all other non-index columns. If None (default), the order is inherited from the original data structure.

column_config (dict or None)

Configures how columns are displayed, e.g. their title, visibility, type, or format, as well as editing properties such as min/max value or step. This needs to be a dictionary where each key is a column name and the value is one of:

None to hide the column.
A string to set the display label of the column.
One of the column types defined under st.column_config, e.g. st.column_config.NumberColumn("Dollar values‚Äù, format=‚Äù$ %d") to show a column as dollar amounts. See more info on the available column types and config options here.

To configure the index column(s), use _index as the column name.

num_rows ("fixed" or "dynamic")

Specifies if the user can add and delete rows in the data editor. If "fixed", the user cannot add or delete rows. If "dynamic", the user can add and delete rows in the data editor, but column sorting is disabled. Defaults to "fixed".

disabled (bool or Iterable of str)

Controls the editing of columns. If True, editing is disabled for all columns. If an Iterable of column names is provided (e.g., disabled=("col1", "col2")), only the specified columns will be disabled for editing. If False (default), all columns that support editing are editable.

key (str)

An optional string to use as the unique key for this widget. If this is omitted, a key will be generated for the widget based on its content. Multiple widgets of the same type may not share the same key.

on_change (callable)

An optional callback invoked when this data_editor's value changes.

args (tuple)

An optional tuple of args to pass to the callback.

kwargs (dict)

An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback.

Returns

(pandas.DataFrame, pandas.Series, pyarrow.Table, numpy.ndarray, list, set, tuple, or dict.)

The edited data. The edited data is returned in its original data type if it corresponds to any of the supported return types. All other data types are returned as a pandas.DataFrame.

Examples
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(
    [
       {"command": "st.selectbox", "rating": 4, "is_widget": True},
       {"command": "st.balloons", "rating": 5, "is_widget": False},
       {"command": "st.time_input", "rating": 3, "is_widget": True},
   ]
)
edited_df = st.data_editor(df)

favorite_command = edited_df.loc[edited_df["rating"].idxmax()]["command"]
st.markdown(f"Your favorite command is **{favorite_command}** üéà")
Copy

You can also allow the user to add and delete rows by setting num_rows to "dynamic":

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(
    [
       {"command": "st.selectbox", "rating": 4, "is_widget": True},
       {"command": "st.balloons", "rating": 5, "is_widget": False},
       {"command": "st.time_input", "rating": 3, "is_widget": True},
   ]
)
edited_df = st.data_editor(df, num_rows="dynamic")

favorite_command = edited_df.loc[edited_df["rating"].idxmax()]["command"]
st.markdown(f"Your favorite command is **{favorite_command}** üéà")
Copy

Or you can customize the data editor via column_config, hide_index, column_order, or disabled:

import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

df = pd.DataFrame(
    [
        {"command": "st.selectbox", "rating": 4, "is_widget": True},
        {"command": "st.balloons", "rating": 5, "is_widget": False},
        {"command": "st.time_input", "rating": 3, "is_widget": True},
    ]
)
edited_df = st.data_editor(
    df,
    column_config={
        "command": "Streamlit Command",
        "rating": st.column_config.NumberColumn(
            "Your rating",
            help="How much do you like this command (1-5)?",
            min_value=1,
            max_value=5,
            step=1,
            format="%d ‚≠ê",
        ),
        "is_widget": "Widget ?",
    },
    disabled=["command", "is_widget"],
    hide_index=True,
)

favorite_command = edited_df.loc[edited_df["rating"].idxmax()]["command"]
st.markdown(f"Your favorite command is **{favorite_command}** üéà")

App testing example
Testing a login page

Let's consider a login page. In this example, secrets.toml is not present. We'll manually declare dummy secrets directly in the tests. To avoid timing attacks, the login script uses hmac to compare a user's password to the secret value as a security best practice.

Project summary
Login page behavior

Before diving into the app's code, let's think about what this page is supposed to do. Whether you use test-driven development or you write unit tests after your code, it's a good idea to think about the functionality that needs to be tested. The login page should behave as follows:

Before a user interacts with the app:
Their status is "unverified."
A password prompt is displayed.
If a user types an incorrect password:
Their status is "incorrect."
An error message is displayed.
The password attempt is cleared from the input.
If a user types a correct password:
Their status is "verified."
A confirmation message is displayed.
A logout button is displayed (without a login prompt).
If a logged-in user clicks the Log out button:
Their status is "unverified."
A password prompt is displayed.
Login page project structure
myproject/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_app.py

Login page Python file

The user's status mentioned in the page's specifications are encoded in st.session_state.status. This value is initialized at the beginning of the script as "unverified" and is updated through a callback when the password prompt receives a new entry.

"""app.py"""
import streamlit as st
import hmac

st.session_state.status = st.session_state.get("status", "unverified")
st.title("My login page")


def check_password():
    if hmac.compare_digest(st.session_state.password, st.secrets.password):
        st.session_state.status = "verified"
    else:
        st.session_state.status = "incorrect"
    st.session_state.password = ""

def login_prompt():
    st.text_input("Enter password:", key="password", on_change=check_password)
    if st.session_state.status == "incorrect":
        st.warning("Incorrect password. Please try again.")

def logout():
    st.session_state.status = "unverified"

def welcome():
    st.success("Login successful.")
    st.button("Log out", on_click=logout)


if st.session_state.status != "verified":
    login_prompt()
    st.stop()
welcome()

Login page test file

These tests closely follow the app's specifications above. In each test, a dummy secret is set before running the app and proceeding with further simulations and checks.

from streamlit.testing.v1 import AppTest

def test_no_interaction():
    at = AppTest.from_file("app.py")
    at.secrets["password"] = "streamlit"
    at.run()
    assert at.session_state["status"] == "unverified"
    assert len(at.text_input) == 1
    assert len(at.warning) == 0
    assert len(at.success) == 0
    assert len(at.button) == 0
    assert at.text_input[0].value == ""

def test_incorrect_password():
    at = AppTest.from_file("app.py")
    at.secrets["password"] = "streamlit"
    at.run()
    at.text_input[0].input("balloon").run()
    assert at.session_state["status"] == "incorrect"
    assert len(at.text_input) == 1
    assert len(at.warning) == 1
    assert len(at.success) == 0
    assert len(at.button) == 0
    assert at.text_input[0].value == ""
    assert "Incorrect password" in at.warning[0].value

def test_correct_password():
    at = AppTest.from_file("app.py")
    at.secrets["password"] = "streamlit"
    at.run()
    at.text_input[0].input("streamlit").run()
    assert at.session_state["status"] == "verified"
    assert len(at.text_input) == 0
    assert len(at.warning) == 0
    assert len(at.success) == 1
    assert len(at.button) == 1
    assert "Login successful" in at.success[0].value
    assert at.button[0].label == "Log out"

def test_log_out():
    at = AppTest.from_file("app.py")
    at.secrets["password"] = "streamlit"
    at.session_state["status"] = "verified"
    at.run()
    at.button[0].click().run()
    assert at.session_state["status"] == "unverified"
    assert len(at.text_input) == 1
    assert len(at.warning) == 0
    assert len(at.success) == 0
    assert len(at.button) == 0
    assert at.text_input[0].value == ""


See how Session State was modified in the last test? Instead of fully simulating a user logging in, the test jumps straight to a logged-in state by setting at.session_state["status"] = "verified". After running the app, the test proceeds to simulate the user logging out.

Limitations

As of Streamlit 1.28, the following Streamlit features are not natively supported by AppTest. However, workarounds are possible for many of them by inspecting the underlying proto directly using AppTest.get(). We plan to regularly add support for missing elements until all features are supported.

Chart elements (st.bar_chart, st.line_chart, etc)
Media elements (st.image, st.video, st.audio)
st.file_uploader
st.data_editor
st.expander
st.status
st.camera_input
st.download_button
st.link_button

Beyond the basics
Beyond the basics of app testing

Now that you're comfortable with executing a basic test for a Streamlit app let's cover the mutable attributes of AppTest:

AppTest.secrets
AppTest.session_state
AppTest.query_params

You can read and update values using dict-like syntax for all three attributes. For .secrets and .query_params, you can use key notation but not attribute notation. For example, the .secrets attribute for AppTest accepts at.secrets["my_key"] but not at.secrets.my_key. This differs from how you can use the associated command in the main library. On the other hand, .session_state allows both key notation and attribute notation.

For these attributes, the typical pattern is to declare any values before executing the app's first run. Values can be inspected at any time in a test. There are a few extra considerations for secrets and Session State, which we'll cover now.

Using secrets with app testing

Be careful not to include secrets directly in your tests. Consider this simple project with pytest executed in the project's root directory:

myproject/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .streamlit/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.toml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ secrets.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_app.py

cd myproject
pytest tests/


In the above scenario, your simulated app will have access to your secrets.toml file. However, since you don't want to commit your secrets to your repository, you may need to write tests where you securely pull your secrets into memory or use dummy secrets.

Example: declaring secrets in a test

Within a test, declare each secret after initializing your AppTest instance but before the first run. (A missing secret may result in an app that doesn't run!) For example, consider the following secrets file and corresponding test initialization to assign the same secrets manually:

Secrets file:

db_username = "Jane"
db_password = "mypassword"

[my_other_secrets]
things_i_like = ["Streamlit", "Python"]


Testing file with equivalent secrets:

# Initialize an AppTest instance.
at = AppTest.from_file("app.py")
# Declare the secrets.
at.secrets["db_username"] = "Jane"
at.secrets["db_password"] = "mypassword"
at.secrets["my_other_secrets.things_i_like"] = ["Streamlit", "Python"]
# Run the app.
at.run()


Generally, you want to avoid typing your secrets directly into your test. If you don't need your real secrets for your test, you can declare dummy secrets as in the example above. If your app uses secrets to connect to an external service like a database or API, consider mocking that service in your app tests. If you need to use the real secrets and actually connect, you should use an API to pass them securely and anonymously. If you are automating your tests with GitHub actions, check out their Security guide.

at.secrets["my_key"] = <value provided through API>

Working with Session State in app testing

The .session_state attribute for AppTest lets you read and update Session State values using key notation (at.session_state["my_key"]) and attribute notation (at.session_state.my_key). By manually declaring values in Session State, you can directly jump to a specific state instead of simulating many steps to get there. Additionally, the testing framework does not provide native support for multipage apps. An instance of AppTest can only test one page. You must manually declare Session State values to simulate a user carrying data from another page.

Example: testing a multipage app

Consider a simple multipage app where the first page can modify a value in Session State. To test the second page, set Session State manually and run the simulated app within the test:

Project structure:

myproject/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ second.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ first.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_second.py


First app page:

"""first.py"""
import streamlit as st

st.session_state.magic_word = st.session_state.get("magic_word", "Streamlit")

new_word = st.text_input("Magic word:")

if st.button("Set the magic word"):
    st.session_state.magic_word = new_word


Second app page:

"""second.py"""
import streamlit as st

st.session_state.magic_word = st.session_state.get("magic_word", "Streamlit")

if st.session_state.magic_word == "Balloons":
    st.markdown(":balloon:")


Testing file:

"""test_second.py"""
from streamlit.testing.v1 import AppTest

def test_balloons():
    at = AppTest.from_file("pages/second.py")
    at.session_state["magic_word"] = "Balloons"
    at.run()
    assert at.markdown[0].value == ":balloon:"


By setting the value at.session_state["magic_word"] = "Balloons" within the test, you can simulate a user navigating to second.py after entering and saving "Balloons" on first.py.

Automate your tests with GitHub actions

One of the key benefits of app testing is that tests can be automated. GitHub Actions are commonly used to validate commits and prevent accidental breaks. As an example, take a look at our streamlit/llm-examples repo. Within .github/workflows, a script creates a virtual Python environment and runs pytest.

Check out GitHub docs to learn about GitHub Actions and Automating Projects using Actions.

Optimize performance with st.cache
delete
Deprecation notice

st.cache was deprecated in version 1.18.0. Use st.cache_data or st.cache_resource instead. Learn more in Caching.

Optimize performance with st.cache

Streamlit provides a caching mechanism that allows your app to stay performant even when loading data from the web, manipulating large datasets, or performing expensive computations. This is done with the @st.cache decorator.

When you mark a function with the @st.cache decorator, it tells Streamlit that whenever the function is called it needs to check a few things:

The input parameters that you called the function with
The value of any external variable used in the function
The body of the function
The body of any function used inside the cached function

If this is the first time Streamlit has seen these four components with these exact values and in this exact combination and order, it runs the function and stores the result in a local cache. Then, next time the cached function is called, if none of these components changed, Streamlit will just skip executing the function altogether and, instead, return the output previously stored in the cache.

The way Streamlit keeps track of changes in these components is through hashing. Think of the cache as an in-memory key-value store, where the key is a hash of all of the above and the value is the actual output object passed by reference.

Finally, @st.cache supports arguments to configure the cache's behavior. You can find more information on those in our API reference.

Let's take a look at a few examples that illustrate how caching works in a Streamlit app.

Example 1: Basic usage

For starters, let's take a look at a sample app that has a function that performs an expensive, long-running computation. Without caching, this function is rerun each time the app is refreshed, leading to a poor user experience. Copy this code into a new app and try it out yourself:

import streamlit as st
import time

def expensive_computation(a, b):
    time.sleep(2)  # üëà This makes the function take 2s to run
    return a * b

a = 2
b = 21
res = expensive_computation(a, b)

st.write("Result:", res)


Try pressing R to rerun the app, and notice how long it takes for the result to show up. This is because expensive_computation(a, b) is being re-executed every time the app runs. This isn't a great experience.

Let's add the @st.cache decorator:

import streamlit as st
import time

@st.cache  # üëà Added this
def expensive_computation(a, b):
    time.sleep(2)  # This makes the function take 2s to run
    return a * b

a = 2
b = 21
res = expensive_computation(a, b)

st.write("Result:", res)


Now run the app again and you'll notice that it is much faster every time you press R to rerun. To understand what is happening, let's add an st.write inside the function:

import streamlit as st
import time

@st.cache(suppress_st_warning=True)  # üëà Changed this
def expensive_computation(a, b):
    # üëá Added this
    st.write("Cache miss: expensive_computation(", a, ",", b, ") ran")
    time.sleep(2)  # This makes the function take 2s to run
    return a * b

a = 2
b = 21
res = expensive_computation(a, b)

st.write("Result:", res)


Now when you rerun the app the text "Cache miss" appears on the first run, but not on any subsequent runs. That's because the cached function is only being executed once, and every time after that you're actually hitting the cache.

push_pin
Note

You may have noticed that we've added the suppress_st_warning keyword to the @st.cache decorators. That's because the cached function above uses a Streamlit command itself (st.write in this case), and when Streamlit sees that, it shows a warning that your command will only execute when you get a cache miss. More often than not, when you see that warning it's because there's a bug in your code. However, in our case we're using the st.write command to demonstrate when the cache is being missed, so the behavior Streamlit is warning us about is exactly what we want. As a result, we are passing in suppress_st_warning=True to turn that warning off.

Example 2: When the function arguments change

Without stopping the previous app server, let's change one of the arguments to our cached function:

import streamlit as st
import time

@st.cache(suppress_st_warning=True)
def expensive_computation(a, b):
    st.write("Cache miss: expensive_computation(", a, ",", b, ") ran")
    time.sleep(2)  # This makes the function take 2s to run
    return a * b

a = 2
b = 210  # üëà Changed this
res = expensive_computation(a, b)

st.write("Result:", res)


Now the first time you rerun the app it's a cache miss. This is evidenced by the "Cache miss" text showing up and the app taking 2s to finish running. After that, if you press R to rerun, it's always a cache hit. That is, no such text shows up and the app is fast again.

This is because Streamlit notices whenever the arguments a and b change and determines whether the function should be re-executed and re-cached.

Example 3: When the function body changes

Without stopping and restarting your Streamlit server, let's remove the widget from our app and modify the function's code by adding a + 1 to the return value.

import streamlit as st
import time

@st.cache(suppress_st_warning=True)
def expensive_computation(a, b):
    st.write("Cache miss: expensive_computation(", a, ",", b, ") ran")
    time.sleep(2)  # This makes the function take 2s to run
    return a * b + 1  # üëà Added a +1 at the end here

a = 2
b = 210
res = expensive_computation(a, b)

st.write("Result:", res)


The first run is a "Cache miss", but when you press R each subsequent run is a cache hit. This is because on first run, Streamlit detected that the function body changed, reran the function, and put the result in the cache.

star
Tip

If you change the function back the result will already be in the Streamlit cache from a previous run. Try it out!

Example 4: When an inner function changes

Let's make our cached function depend on another function internally:

import streamlit as st
import time

def inner_func(a, b):
    st.write("inner_func(", a, ",", b, ") ran")
    return a * b

@st.cache(suppress_st_warning=True)
def expensive_computation(a, b):
    st.write("Cache miss: expensive_computation(", a, ",", b, ") ran")
    time.sleep(2)  # This makes the function take 2s to run
    return inner_func(a, b) + 1

a = 2
b = 210
res = expensive_computation(a, b)

st.write("Result:", res)


What you see is the usual:

The first run results in a cache miss.
Every subsequent rerun results in a cache hit.

But now let's try modifying the inner_func():

import streamlit as st
import time

def inner_func(a, b):
    st.write("inner_func(", a, ",", b, ") ran")
    return a ** b  # üëà Changed the * to ** here

@st.cache(suppress_st_warning=True)
def expensive_computation(a, b):
    st.write("Cache miss: expensive_computation(", a, ",", b, ") ran")
    time.sleep(2)  # This makes the function take 2s to run
    return inner_func(a, b) + 1

a = 2
b = 21
res = expensive_computation(a, b)

st.write("Result:", res)


Even though inner_func() is not annotated with @st.cache, when we edit its body we cause a "Cache miss" in the outer expensive_computation().

That's because Streamlit always traverses your code and its dependencies to verify that the cached values are still valid. This means that while developing your app you can edit your code freely without worrying about the cache. Any change you make to your app, Streamlit should do the right thing!

Streamlit is also smart enough to only traverse dependencies that belong to your app, and skip over any dependency that comes from an installed Python library.

Example 5: Use caching to speed up your app across users

Going back to our original function, let's add a widget to control the value of b:

import streamlit as st
import time

@st.cache(suppress_st_warning=True)
def expensive_computation(a, b):
    st.write("Cache miss: expensive_computation(", a, ",", b, ") ran")
    time.sleep(2)  # This makes the function take 2s to run
    return a * b

a = 2
b = st.slider("Pick a number", 0, 10)  # üëà Changed this
res = expensive_computation(a, b)

st.write("Result:", res)


What you'll see:

If you move the slider to a number Streamlit hasn't seen before, you'll have a cache miss again. And every subsequent rerun with the same number will be a cache hit, of course.
If you move the slider back to a number Streamlit has seen before, the cache is hit and the app is fast as expected.

In computer science terms, what is happening here is that @st.cache is memoizing expensive_computation(a, b).

But now let's go one step further! Try the following:

Move the slider to a number you haven't tried before, such as 9.
Pretend you're another user by opening another browser tab pointing to your Streamlit app (usually at http://localhost:8501)
In the new tab, move the slider to 9.

Notice how this is actually a cache hit! That is, you don't actually see the "Cache miss" text on the second tab even though that second user never moved the slider to 9 at any point prior to this.

This happens because the Streamlit cache is global to all users. So everyone contributes to everyone else's performance.

Example 6: Mutating cached values

As mentioned in the overview section, the Streamlit cache stores items by reference. This allows the Streamlit cache to support structures that aren't memory-managed by Python, such as TensorFlow objects. However, it can also lead to unexpected behavior ‚Äî which is why Streamlit has a few checks to guide developers in the right direction. Let's look into those checks now.

Let's write an app that has a cached function which returns a mutable object, and then let's follow up by mutating that object:

import streamlit as st
import time

@st.cache(suppress_st_warning=True)
def expensive_computation(a, b):
    st.write("Cache miss: expensive_computation(", a, ",", b, ") ran")
    time.sleep(2)  # This makes the function take 2s to run
    return {"output": a * b}  # üëà Mutable object

a = 2
b = 21
res = expensive_computation(a, b)

st.write("Result:", res)

res["output"] = "result was manually mutated"  # üëà Mutated cached value

st.write("Mutated result:", res)


When you run this app for the first time, you should see three messages on the screen:

Cache miss: expensive_computation(...) ran
Result: {output: 42}
Mutated result: {output: "result was manually mutated"}


No surprises here. But now notice what happens when you rerun you app (i.e. press R):

Result: {output: "result was manually mutated"}
Mutated result: {output: "result was manually mutated"}
Cached object mutated. (...)


So what's up?

What's going on here is that Streamlit caches the output res by reference. When you mutated res["output"] outside the cached function you ended up inadvertently modifying the cache. This means every subsequent call to expensive_computation(2, 21) will return the wrong value!

Since this behavior is usually not what you'd expect, Streamlit tries to be helpful and show you a warning, along with some ideas about how to fix your code.

In this specific case, the fix is just to not mutate res["output"] outside the cached function. There was no good reason for us to do that anyway! Another solution would be to clone the result value with res = deepcopy(expensive_computation(2, 21)). Check out the section entitled Fixing caching issues for more information on these approaches and more.

Advanced caching

In caching, you learned about the Streamlit cache, which is accessed with the @st.cache decorator. In this article you'll see how Streamlit's caching functionality is implemented, so that you can use it to improve the performance of your Streamlit apps.

The cache is a key-value store, where the key is a hash of:

The input parameters that you called the function with
The value of any external variable used in the function
The body of the function
The body of any function used inside the cached function

And the value is a tuple of:

The cached output
A hash of the cached output (you'll see why soon)

For both the key and the output hash, Streamlit uses a specialized hash function that knows how to traverse code, hash special objects, and can have its behavior customized by the user.

For example, when the function expensive_computation(a, b), decorated with @st.cache, is executed with a=2 and b=21, Streamlit does the following:

Computes the cache key
If the key is found in the cache, then:
Extracts the previously-cached (output, output_hash) tuple.
Performs an Output Mutation Check, where a fresh hash of the output is computed and compared to the stored output_hash.
If the two hashes are different, shows a Cached Object Mutated warning. (Note: Setting allow_output_mutation=True disables this step).
If the input key is not found in the cache, then:
Executes the cached function (i.e. output = expensive_computation(2, 21)).
Calculates the output_hash from the function's output.
Stores key ‚Üí (output, output_hash) in the cache.
Returns the output.

If an error is encountered an exception is raised. If the error occurs while hashing either the key or the output an UnhashableTypeError error is thrown. If you run into any issues, see fixing caching issues.

The hash_funcs parameter

As described above, Streamlit's caching functionality relies on hashing to calculate the key for cached objects, and to detect unexpected mutations in the cached result.

For added expressive power, Streamlit lets you override this hashing process using the hash_funcs argument. Suppose you define a type called FileReference which points to a file in the filesystem:

class FileReference:
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename


@st.cache
def func(file_reference):
    ...


By default, Streamlit hashes custom classes like FileReference by recursively navigating their structure. In this case, its hash is the hash of the filename property. As long as the file name doesn't change, the hash will remain constant.

However, what if you wanted to have the hasher check for changes to the file's modification time, not just its name? This is possible with @st.cache's hash_funcs parameter:

class FileReference:
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename

def hash_file_reference(file_reference):
    filename = file_reference.filename
    return (filename, os.path.getmtime(filename))

@st.cache(hash_funcs={FileReference: hash_file_reference})
def func(file_reference):
    ...


Additionally, you can hash FileReference objects by the file's contents:

class FileReference:
    def __init__(self, filename):
        self.filename = filename

def hash_file_reference(file_reference):
    with open(file_reference.filename) as f:
      return f.read()

@st.cache(hash_funcs={FileReference: hash_file_reference})
def func(file_reference):
    ...

push_pin
Note

Because Streamlit's hash function works recursively, you don't have to hash the contents inside hash_file_reference Instead, you can return a primitive type, in this case the contents of the file, and Streamlit's internal hasher will compute the actual hash from it.

Typical hash functions

While it's possible to write custom hash functions, let's take a look at some of the tools that Python provides out of the box. Here's a list of some hash functions and when it makes sense to use them.

Python's id function | Example

Speed: Fast
Use case: If you're hashing a singleton object, like an open database connection or a TensorFlow session. These are objects that will only be instantiated once, no matter how many times your script reruns.

lambda _: None | Example

Speed: Fast
Use case: If you want to turn off hashing of this type. This is useful if you know the object is not going to change.

Python's hash() function | Example

Speed: Can be slow based the size of the object being cached
Use case: If Python already knows how to hash this type correctly.

Custom hash function | Example

Speed: N/a
Use case: If you'd like to override how Streamlit hashes a particular type.
Example 1: Pass a database connection around

Suppose we want to open a database connection that can be reused across multiple runs of a Streamlit app. For this you can make use of the fact that cached objects are stored by reference to automatically initialize and reuse the connection:

@st.cache(allow_output_mutation=True)
def get_database_connection():
    return db.get_connection()


With just 3 lines of code, the database connection is created once and stored in the cache. Then, every subsequent time get_database_connection is called, the already-created connection object is reused automatically. In other words, it becomes a singleton.

star
Tip

Use the allow_output_mutation=True flag to suppress the immutability check. This prevents Streamlit from trying to hash the output connection, and also turns off Streamlit's mutation warning in the process.

What if you want to write a function that receives a database connection as input? For that, you'll use hash_funcs:

@st.cache(hash_funcs={DBConnection: id})
def get_users(connection):
    # Note: We assume that connection is of type DBConnection.
    return connection.execute_sql('SELECT * from Users')


Here, we use Python's built-in id function, because the connection object is coming from the Streamlit cache via the get_database_connection function. This means that the same connection instance is passed around every time, and therefore it always has the same id. However, if you happened to have a second connection object around that pointed to an entirely different database, it would still be safe to pass it to get_users because its id is guaranteed to be different than the first id.

These design patterns apply any time you have an object that points to an external resource, such as a database connection or Tensorflow session.

Example 2: Turn off hashing for a specific type

You can turn off hashing entirely for a particular type by giving it a custom hash function that returns a constant. One reason that you might do this is to avoid hashing large, slow-to-hash objects that you know are not going to change. For example:

@st.cache(hash_funcs={pd.DataFrame: lambda _: None})
def func(huge_constant_dataframe):
    ...


When Streamlit encounters an object of this type, it always converts the object into None, no matter which instance of FooType its looking at. This means all instances are hash to the same value, which effectively cancels out the hashing mechanism.

Example 3: Use Python's hash() function

Sometimes, you might want to use Python‚Äôs default hashing instead of Streamlit's. For example, maybe you've encountered a type that Streamlit is unable to hash, but it's hashable with Python's built-in hash() function:

@st.cache(hash_funcs={FooType: hash})
def func(...):
    ...

Get started with app testing

This guide will cover a simple example of how tests are structured within a project and how to execute them with pytest. After seeing the big picture, keep reading to learn about the Fundamentals of app testing:

Initializing and running a simulated app
Retrieving elements
Manipulating widgets
Inspecting the results

Streamlit's app testing framework is not tied to any particular testing tool, but we'll use pytest for our examples since it is one of the most common Python test frameworks. To try out the examples in this guide, be sure to install pytest into your Streamlit development environment before you begin:

pip install pytest

A simple testing example with
pytest

This section explains how a simple test is structured and executed with pytest. For a comprehensive introduction to pytest, check out Real Python's guide to Effective Python testing with pytest.

How
pytest
is structured

pytest uses a naming convention for files and functions to execute tests conveniently. Name your test scripts of the form test_<name>.py or <name>_test.py. For example, you can use test_myapp.py or myapp_test.py. Within your test scripts, each test is written as a function. Each function is named to begin or end with test. We will prefix all our test scripts and test functions with test_ for our examples in this guide.

You can write as many tests (functions) within a single test script as you want. When calling pytest in a directory, all test_<name>.py files within it will be used for testing. This includes files within subdirectories. Each test_<something> function within those files will be executed as a test. You can place test files anywhere in your project directory, but it is common to collect tests into a designated tests/ directory. For other ways to structure and execute tests, check out How to invoke pytest in the pytest docs.

Example project with app testing

Consider the following project:

myproject/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_app.py


Main app file:

"""app.py"""
import streamlit as st

# Initialize st.session_state.beans
st.session_state.beans = st.session_state.get("beans", 0)

st.title("Bean counter :paw_prints:")

addend = st.number_input("Beans to add", 0, 10)
if st.button("Add"):
    st.session_state.beans += addend
st.markdown(f"Beans counted: {st.session_state.beans}")


Testing file:

"""test_app.py"""
from streamlit.testing.v1 import AppTest

def test_increment_and_add():
    """A user increments the number input, then clicks Add"""
    at = AppTest.from_file("app.py").run()
    at.number_input[0].increment().run()
    at.button[0].click().run()
    assert at.markdown[0].value == "Beans counted: 1"


Let's take a quick look at what's in this app and test before we run it. The main app file (app.py) contains four elements when rendered: st.title, st.number_input, st.button, and st.markdown. The test script (test_app.py) includes a single test (the function named test_increment_and_add). We'll cover test syntax in more detail in the latter half of this guide, but here's a brief explanation of what this test does:

Initialize the simulated app and execute the first script run.
at = AppTest.from_file("app.py").run()

Simulate a user clicking the plus icon (add) to increment the number input (and the resulting script rerun).
at.number_input[0].increment().run()

Simulate a user clicking the "Add" button (and the resulting script rerun).
at.button[0].click().run()

Check if the correct message is displayed at the end.
assert at.markdown[0].value == "Beans counted: 1"


Assertions are the heart of tests. When the assertion is true, the test passes. When the assertion is false, the test fails. A test can have multiple assertions, but keeping tests tightly focused is good practice. When tests focus on a single behavior, it is easier to understand and respond to failure.

Try out a simple test with
pytest
Copy the files above into a new "myproject" directory.
Open a terminal and change directory to your project.
cd myproject

Execute pytest:
pytest


The test should execute successfully. Your terminal should show something like this:

By executing pytest at the root of your project directory, all Python files with the test prefix (test_<name>.py) will be scanned for test functions. Within each test file, each function with the test prefix will be executed as a test. pytest then counts successes and itemizes failures. You can also direct pytest to only scan your testing directory. For example, from the root of your project directory, execute:

pytest tests/

Handling file paths and imports with
pytest

Imports and paths within a test script should be relative to the directory where pytest is called. That is why the test function uses the path app.py instead of ../app.py even though the app file is one directory up from the test script. You'll usually call pytest from the directory containing your main app file. This is typically the root of your project directory.

Additionally, if .streamlit/ is present in the directory where you call pytest, any config.toml and secrets.toml within it will be accessible to your simulated app. For example, your simulated app will have access to the config.toml and secrets.toml files in this common setup:

Project structure:

myproject/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .streamlit/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.toml
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ secrets.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_app.py


Initialization within test_app.py:

# Path to app file is relative to myproject/
at = AppTest.from_file("app.py").run()


Command to execute tests:

cd myproject
pytest tests/

Fundamentals of app testing

Now that you understand the basics of pytest let's dive into using Streamlit's app testing framework. Every test begins with initializing and running your simulated app. Additional commands are used to retrieve, manipulate, and inspect elements.

On the next page, we'll go Beyond the basics and cover more advanced scenarios like working with secrets, Session State, or multipage apps.

How to initialize and run a simulated app

To test a Streamlit app, you must first initialize an instance of AppTest with the code for one page of your app. There are three methods for initializing a simulated app. These are provided as class methods to AppTest. We will focus on AppTest.from_file() which allows you to provide a path to a page of your app. This is the most common scenario for building automated tests during app development. AppTest.from_string() and AppTest.from_function() may be helpful for some simple or experimental scenarios.

Let's continue with the example from above.

Recall the testing file:

"""test_app.py"""
from streamlit.testing.v1 import AppTest

def test_increment_and_add():
    """A user increments the number input, then clicks Add"""
    at = AppTest.from_file("app.py").run()
    at.number_input[0].increment().run()
    at.button[0].click().run()
    assert at.markdown[0].value == "Beans counted: 1"


Look at the first line in the test function:

at = AppTest.from_file("app.py").run()


This is doing two things and is equivalent to:

# Initialize the app.
at = AppTest.from_file("app.py")
# Run the app.
at.run()


AppTest.from_file() returns an instance of AppTest, initialized with the contents of app.py. The .run() method is used to run the app for the first time. Looking at the test, notice that the .run() method manually executes each script run. A test must explicitly run the app each time. This applies to the app's first run and any rerun resulting from simulated user input.

How to retrieve elements

The attributes of the AppTest class return sequences of elements. The elements are sorted according to display order in the rendered app. Specific elements can be retrieved by index. Additionally, widgets with keys can be retrieved by key.

Retrieve elements by index

Each attribute of AppTest returns a sequence of the associated element type. Specific elements can be retrieved by index. In the above example, at.number_input returns a sequence of all st.number_input elements in the app. Thus, at.number_input[0] is the first such element in the app. Similarly, at.markdown returns a collection of all st.markdown elements where at.markdown[0] is the first such element.

Check out the current list of supported elements in the "Attributes" section of the AppTest class or the App testing cheat sheet. You can also use the .get() method and pass the attribute's name. at.get("number_input") and at.get("markdown") are equivalent to at.number_input and at.markdown, respectively.

The returned sequence of elements is ordered by appearance on the page. If containers are used to insert elements in a different order, these sequences may not match the order within your code. Consider the following example where containers are used to switch the order of two buttons on the page:

import streamlit as st

first = st.container()
second = st.container()

second.button("A")
first.button("B")


If the above app was tested, the first button (at.button[0]) would be labeled "B" and the second button (at.button[1]) would be labeled "A." As true assertions, these would be:

assert at.button[0].label == "B"
assert at.button[1].label == "A"

Retrieve widgets by key

You can retrieve keyed widgets by their keys instead of their order on the page. The key of the widget is passed as either an arg or kwarg. For example, look at this app and the following (true) assertions:

import streamlit as st

st.button("Next", key="submit")
st.button("Back", key="cancel")

assert at.button(key="submit").label == "Next"
assert at.button("cancel").label == "Back"

Retrieve containers

You can also narrow down your sequences of elements by retrieving specific containers. Each retrieved container has the same attributes as AppTest. For example, at.sidebar.checkbox returns a sequence of all checkboxes in the sidebar. at.main.selectbox returns the sequence of all selectboxes in the main body of the app (not in the sidebar).

For AppTest.columns and AppTest.tabs, a sequence of containers is returned. So at.columns[0].button would be the sequence of all buttons in the first column appearing in the app.

How to manipulate widgets

All widgets have a universal .set_value() method. Additionally, many widgets have specific methods for manipulating their value. The names of Testing element classes closely match the names of the AppTest attributes. For example, look at the return type of AppTest.button to see the corresponding class of Button. Aside from setting the value of a button with .set_value(), you can also use .click(). Check out each testing element class for its specific methods.

How to inspect elements

All elements, including widgets, have a universal .value property. This returns the contents of the element. For widgets, this is the same as the return value or value in Session State. For non-input elements, this will be the value of the primary contents argument. For example, .value returns the value of body for st.markdown or st.error. It returns the value of data for st.dataframe or st.table.

Additionally, you can check many other details for widgets like labels or disabled status. Many parameters are available for inspection, but not all. Use linting software to see what is currently supported. Here's an example:

import streamlit as st

st.selectbox("A", [1,2,3], None, help="Pick a number", placeholder="Pick me")

assert at.selectbox[0].value == None
assert at.selectbox[0].label == "A"
assert at.selectbox[0].options == ["1","2","3"]
assert at.selectbox[0].index == None
assert at.selectbox[0].help == "Pick a number"
assert at.selectbox[0].placeholder == "Pick me"
assert at.selectbox[0].disabled == False

star
Tip

Note that the options for st.selectbox were declared as integers but asserted as strings. As noted in the documentation for st.selectbox, options are cast internally to strings. If you ever find yourself getting unexpected results, check the documentation carefully for any notes about recasting types internally.

Deprecation notice

The experimental cache primitives described on this page were deprecated in version 1.18.0. Use st.cache_data or st.cache_resource instead. Learn more in Caching.

Experimental cache primitives
Overview

Streamlit's unique execution model is a part of what makes it a joy to use: your code executes from top to bottom like a simple script for every interaction. There's no need to think about models, views, controllers, or anything of the sort.

Whenever your code re-executes, a decorator called @st.cache‚Äîwhich is a powerful primitive for memoization and state storage capabilities‚Äîprovides a caching mechanism that allows your app to stay performant even when loading data from the web, manipulating large datasets, or performing expensive computations.

However, we've found that @st.cache is hard to use and not fast. You're either faced with cryptic errors like InternalHashError or UnhashableTypeError. Or you need to understand concepts like hash_funcs and allow_output_mutation.

Our solutions include two new primitives: st.experimental_memo and st.experimental_singleton. They're conceptually simpler and much, much faster. In some of our internal tests on caching large dataframes, @st.experimental_memo has outperformed @st.cache by an order of magnitude. That's over 10X faster! üöÄ

Let's take a look at the use-cases these two experimental APIs serve, and how they're a significant improvement over @st.cache.

Problem

@st.cache was serving the following use-cases:

Storing computation results given different kinds of inputs. In Computer Science literature, this is called memoization.
Initializing an object exactly once, and reusing that same instance on each rerun for the Streamlit server's lifetime. This is called the singleton pattern.
Storing global state to be shared and modified across multiple Streamlit sessions (and, since Streamlit is threaded, you need to pay special attention to thread-safety).

As a result of @st.cache trying to cover too many use-cases under a single unified API, it's both slow and complex.

Solution

While @st.cache tries to solve two very different problems simultaneously (caching data and sharing global singleton objects), these new primitives simplify things by dividing the problem across two different APIs. As a result, they are faster and simpler.

@st.experimental_memo

Use @st.experimental_memo to store expensive computation which can be "cached" or "memoized" in the traditional sense. It has almost the exact same API as the existing @st.cache, so you can often blindly replace one for the other:

import streamlit as st

@st.experimental_memo
def factorial(n):
	if n < 1:
		return 1
	return n * factorial(n - 1)

f10 = factorial(10)
f9 = factorial(9)  # Returns instantly!

Properties
Unlike @st.cache, this returns cached items by value, not by reference. This means that you no longer have to worry about accidentally mutating the items stored in the cache. Behind the scenes, this is done by using Python's pickle() function to serialize/deserialize cached values.
Although this uses a custom hashing solution for generating cache keys (like @st.cache), it does not use hash_funcs as an escape hatch for unhashable parameters. Instead, we allow you to ignore unhashable parameters (e.g. database connections) by prefixing them with an underscore.

For example:

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

@st.experimental_memo
def get_page(_sessionmaker, page_size, page):
	"""Retrieve rows from the RNA database, and cache them.

	Parameters
	----------
	_sessionmaker : a SQLAlchemy session factory. Because this arg name is
	                prefixed with "_", it won't be hashed.
	page_size : the number of rows in a page of result
	page : the page number to retrieve

	Returns
	-------
	pandas.DataFrame
	A DataFrame containing the retrieved rows. Mutating it won't affect
	the cache.
	"""
	with _sessionmaker() as session:
		query = (
			session
				.query(RNA.id, RNA.seq_short, RNA.seq_long, RNA.len, RNA.upi)
				.order_by(RNA.id)
				.offset(page_size * page)
				.limit(page_size)
		)

		return pd.read_sql(query.statement, query.session.bind)

@st.experimental_singleton

@st.experimental_singleton is a key-value store that's shared across all sessions of a Streamlit app. It's great for storing heavyweight singleton objects across sessions (like TensorFlow/Torch/Keras sessions and/or database connections).

Example usage:

import streamlit as st
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

@st.experimental_singleton
def get_db_sessionmaker():
	# This is for illustration purposes only
	DB_URL = "your-db-url"
	engine = create_engine(DB_URL)
	return sessionmaker(engine)

dbsm = get_db_sessionmaker()

How this compares to @st.cache:
Like @st.cache, this returns items by reference.
You can return any object type, including objects that are not serializable.
Unlike @st.cache, this decorator does not have additional logic to check whether you are unexpectedly mutating the cached object. That logic was slow and produced confusing error messages. So, instead, we're hoping that by calling this decorator "singleton," we're nudging you to the correct behavior.
This does not follow the computation graph.
You don't have to worry about hash_funcs! Just prefix your arguments with an underscore to ignore them.
priority_high
Warning

Singleton objects can be used concurrently by every user connected to your app, and you are responsible for ensuring that @st.singleton objects are thread-safe. (Most objects you'd want to stick inside an @st.singleton annotation are probably already safe‚Äîbut you should verify this.)

Which to use: memo or singleton?

Decide between @st.experimental_memo and @st.experimental_singleton based on your function's return type. Functions that return data should use memo. Functions that return non-data objects should use singleton.

For example:

Dataframe computation (pandas, numpy, etc): this is *data‚Äî*use memo
Storing downloaded data: memo
Calculating pi to n digits: memo
Tensorflow session: this is a *non-data object‚Äî*use singleton
Database connection: singleton
Clear memo and singleton caches procedurally

You can clear caches of functions decorated with @st.experimental_memo and @st.experimental_singleton in code. For example, you can do the following:

@st.experimental_memo
def square(x):
    return x**2

if st.button("Clear Square"):
    # Clear square's memoized values:
    square.clear()

if st.button("Clear All"):
    # Clear values from *all* memoized functions:
    st.experimental_memo.clear()


Pressing the "Clear Square" button will clear square()'s memoized values. Pressing the "Clear All" button will clear memoized values from all functions decorated with @st.experimental_memo.

In summary:

Any function annotated with @st.experimental_memo or @st.experimental_singleton gets its own clear() function automatically.
Additionally, you can use st.experimental_memo.clear() and st.experimental_singleton.clear() to clear all memo and singleton caches, respectively.
push_pin
Note

The commands are experimental, so they're governed by our experimental API process.

These specialized memoization and singleton commands represent a big step in Streamlit's evolution, with the potential to entirely replace @st.cache at some point in 2022.

Yes, today you may use @st.cache for storing data you pulled in from a database connection (for a Tensorflow session, for caching the results of a long computation like changing the datetime values on a pandas dataframe, etc.). But these are very different things, so we made two new functions that will make it much faster! üí®

Please help us out by testing these commands in real apps and leaving comments in the Streamlit forums.

Deprecation notice

st.experimental_singleton was deprecated in version 1.18.0. Use st.cache_resource instead. Learn more in Caching.

Decorator to cache functions that return global resources (e.g. database connections, ML models).

Cached objects are shared across all users, sessions, and reruns. They must be thread-safe because they can be accessed from multiple threads concurrently. If thread safety is an issue, consider using st.session_state to store resources per session instead.

You can clear a function's cache with func.clear() or clear the entire cache with st.cache_resource.clear().

To cache data, use st.cache_data instead. Learn more about caching at https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching.

Function signature
[source]

st.experimental_singleton(func, *, ttl, max_entries, show_spinner, validate, experimental_allow_widgets, hash_funcs=None)

Parameters

func (callable)

The function that creates the cached resource. Streamlit hashes the function's source code.

ttl (float, timedelta, str, or None)

The maximum time to keep an entry in the cache. Can be one of:

None if cache entries should never expire (default).
A number specifying the time in seconds.
A string specifying the time in a format supported by Pandas's Timedelta constructor, e.g. "1d", "1.5 days", or "1h23s".
A timedelta object from Python's built-in datetime library, e.g. timedelta(days=1).

max_entries (int or None)

The maximum number of entries to keep in the cache, or None for an unbounded cache. When a new entry is added to a full cache, the oldest cached entry will be removed. Defaults to None.

show_spinner (bool or str)

Enable the spinner. Default is True to show a spinner when there is a "cache miss" and the cached resource is being created. If string, value of show_spinner param will be used for spinner text.

validate (callable or None)

An optional validation function for cached data. validate is called each time the cached value is accessed. It receives the cached value as its only parameter and it must return a boolean. If validate returns False, the current cached value is discarded, and the decorated function is called to compute a new value. This is useful e.g. to check the health of database connections.

experimental_allow_widgets (bool)

Allow widgets to be used in the cached function. Defaults to False. Support for widgets in cached functions is currently experimental. Setting this parameter to True may lead to excessive memory use since the widget value is treated as an additional input parameter to the cache. We may remove support for this option at any time without notice.

hash_funcs (dict or None)

Mapping of types or fully qualified names to hash functions. This is used to override the behavior of the hasher inside Streamlit's caching mechanism: when the hasher encounters an object, it will first check to see if its type matches a key in this dict and, if so, will use the provided function to generate a hash for it. See below for an example of how this can be used.

Example
import streamlit as st

@st.cache_resource
def get_database_session(url):
    # Create a database session object that points to the URL.
    return session

s1 = get_database_session(SESSION_URL_1)
# Actually executes the function, since this is the first time it was
# encountered.

s2 = get_database_session(SESSION_URL_1)
# Does not execute the function. Instead, returns its previously computed
# value. This means that now the connection object in s1 is the same as in s2.

s3 = get_database_session(SESSION_URL_2)
# This is a different URL, so the function executes.
Copy

By default, all parameters to a cache_resource function must be hashable. Any parameter whose name begins with _ will not be hashed. You can use this as an "escape hatch" for parameters that are not hashable:

import streamlit as st

@st.cache_resource
def get_database_session(_sessionmaker, url):
    # Create a database connection object that points to the URL.
    return connection

s1 = get_database_session(create_sessionmaker(), DATA_URL_1)
# Actually executes the function, since this is the first time it was
# encountered.

s2 = get_database_session(create_sessionmaker(), DATA_URL_1)
# Does not execute the function. Instead, returns its previously computed
# value - even though the _sessionmaker parameter was different
# in both calls.
Copy

A cache_resource function's cache can be procedurally cleared:

import streamlit as st

@st.cache_resource
def get_database_session(_sessionmaker, url):
    # Create a database connection object that points to the URL.
    return connection

get_database_session.clear()
# Clear all cached entries for this function.
Copy

To override the default hashing behavior, pass a custom hash function. You can do that by mapping a type (e.g. Person) to a hash function (str) like this:

import streamlit as st
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Person(BaseModel):
    name: str

@st.cache_resource(hash_funcs={Person: str})
def get_person_name(person: Person):
    return person.name
Copy

Alternatively, you can map the type's fully-qualified name (e.g. "__main__.Person") to the hash function instead:

import streamlit as st
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Person(BaseModel):
    name: str

@st.cache_resource(hash_funcs={"__main__.Person": str})
def get_person_name(person: Person):
    return person.name
Copy

Deprecation notice

st.experimental_singleton.clear was deprecated in version 1.18.0. Use st.cache_resource.clear instead. Learn more in Caching.

Clear all cache_resource caches.

Function signature
[source]

st.experimental_singleton.clear()

Example

In the example below, pressing the "Clear All" button will clear all singleton caches. i.e. Clears cached singleton objects from all functions decorated with @st.experimental_singleton.

import streamlit as st
from transformers import BertModel

@st.experimental_singleton
 def get_database_session(url):
     # Create a database session object that points to the URL.
     return session

@st.experimental_singleton
def get_model(model_type):
    # Create a model of the specified type.
    return BertModel.from_pretrained(model_type)

if st.button("Clear All"):
    # Clears all singleton caches:
    st.experimental_singleton.clear()

Validating the cache

The @st.experimental_singleton decorator is used to cache the output of a function, so that it only needs to be executed once. This can improve performance in certain situations, such as when a function takes a long time to execute or makes a network request.

However, in some cases, the cached output may become invalid over time, such as when a database connection times out. To handle this, the @st.experimental_singleton decorator supports an optional validate parameter, which accepts a validation function that is called each time the cached output is accessed. If the validation function returns False, the cached output is discarded and the decorated function is executed again.

Best Practices
Use the validate parameter when the cached output may become invalid over time, such as when a database connection or an API key expires.
Use the validate parameter judiciously, as it will add an additional overhead of calling the validation function each time the cached output is accessed.
Make sure that the validation function is as fast as possible, as it will be called each time the cached output is accessed.
Consider to validate cached data periodically, instead of each time it is accessed, to mitigate the performance impact.
Handle errors that may occur during validation and provide a fallback mechanism if the validation fails.
Replay static
st
elements in cache-decorated functions

Functions decorated with @st.experimental_singleton can contain static st elements. When a cache-decorated function is executed, we record the element and block messages produced, so the elements will appear in the app even when execution of the function is skipped because the result was cached.

In the example below, the @st.experimental_singleton decorator is used to cache the execution of the get_model function, that returns a ü§ó Hugging Face Transformers model. Notice the cached function also contains a st.bar_chart command, which will be replayed when the function is skipped because the result was cached.

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
from transformers import AutoModel

@st.experimental_singleton
def get_model(model_type):
    # Contains a static element st.bar_chart
    st.bar_chart(
        np.random.rand(10, 1)
    )  # This will be recorded and displayed even when the function is skipped

    # Create a model of the specified type
    return AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_type)

bert_model = get_model("distilbert-base-uncased")
st.help(bert_model) # Display the model's docstring


Supported static st elements in cache-decorated functions include:

st.alert
st.altair_chart
st.area_chart
st.audio
st.bar_chart
st.ballons
st.bokeh_chart
st.caption
st.code
st.components.v1.html
st.components.v1.iframe
st.container
st.dataframe
st.echo
st.empty
st.error
st.exception
st.expander
st.experimental_get_query_params
st.experimental_set_query_params
st.form
st.form_submit_button
st.graphviz_chart
st.help
st.image
st.info
st.json
st.latex
st.line_chart
st.markdown
st.metric
st.plotly_chart
st.progress
st.pydeck_chart
st.snow
st.spinner
st.success
st.table
st.text
st.vega_lite_chart
st.video
st.warning
Replay input widgets in cache-decorated functions

In addition to static elements, functions decorated with @st.experimental_singleton can also contain input widgets! Replaying input widgets is disabled by default. To enable it, you can set the experimental_allow_widgets parameter for @st.experimental_singleton to True. The example below enables widget replaying, and shows the use of a checkbox widget within a cache-decorated function.

import streamlit as st

# Enable widget replay
@st.experimental_singleton(experimental_allow_widgets=True)
def func():
    # Contains an input widget
    st.checkbox("Works!")

func()


If the cache decorated function contains input widgets, but experimental_allow_widgets is set to False or unset, Streamlit will throw a CachedStFunctionWarning, like the one below:

import streamlit as st

# Widget replay is disabled by default
@st.experimental_singleton
def func():
    # Streamlit will throw a CachedStFunctionWarning
    st.checkbox("Doesn't work")

func()

How widget replay works

Let's demystify how widget replay in cache-decorated functions works and gain a conceptual understanding. Widget values are treated as additional inputs to the function, and are used to determine whether the function should be executed or not. Consider the following example:

import streamlit as st

@st.experimental_singleton(experimental_allow_widgets=True)
def plus_one(x):
    y = x + 1
    if st.checkbox("Nuke the value üí•"):
        st.write("Value was nuked, returning 0")
        y = 0
    return y

st.write(plus_one(2))


The plus_one function takes an integer x as input, and returns x + 1. The function also contains a checkbox widget, which is used to "nuke" the value of x. i.e. the return value of plus_one depends on the state of the checkbox: if it is checked, the function returns 0, otherwise it returns 3.

In order to know which value the cache should return (in case of a cache hit), Streamlit treats the checkbox state (checked / unchecked) as an additional input to the function plus_one (just like x). If the user checks the checkbox (thereby changing its state), we look up the cache for the same value of x (2) and the same checkbox state (checked). If the cache contains a value for this combination of inputs, we return it. Otherwise, we execute the function and store the result in the cache.

Let's now understand how enabling and disabling widget replay changes the behavior of the function.

Widget replay disabled
Widgets in cached functions throw a CachedStFunctionWarning and are ignored.
Other static elements in cached functions replay as expected.
Widget replay enabled
Widgets in cached functions don't lead to a warning, and are replayed as expected.
Interacting with a widget in a cached function will cause the function to be executed again, and the cache to be updated.
Widgets in cached functions retain their state across reruns.
Each unique combination of widget values is treated as a separate input to the function, and is used to determine whether the function should be executed or not. i.e. Each unique combination of widget values has its own cache entry; the cached function runs the first time and the saved value is used afterwards.
Calling a cached function multiple times in one script run with the same arguments triggers a DuplicateWidgetID error.
If the arguments to a cached function change, widgets from that function that render again retain their state.
Changing the source code of a cached function invalidates the cache.
Both st.experimental_singleton and st.experimental_memo support widget replay.
Fundamentally, the behavior of a function with (supported) widgets in it doesn't change when it is decorated with @st.experimental_singleton or @st.experimental_memo. The only difference is that the function is only executed when we detect a cache "miss".
Supported widgets

All input widgets are supported in cache-decorated functions. The following is an exhaustive list of supported widgets:

st.button
st.camera_input
st.checkbox
st.color_picker
st.date_input
st.download_button
st.file_uploader
st.multiselect
st.number_input

Deprecation notice

st.connections.ExperimentalBaseConnection was deprecated in version 1.28.0. Use st.connections.BaseConnection instead.

The abstract base class that all Streamlit Connections must inherit from.

This base class provides connection authors with a standardized way to hook into the st.connection() factory function: connection authors are required to provide an implementation for the abstract method _connect in their subclasses.

Additionally, it also provides a few methods/properties designed to make implementation of connections more convenient. See the docstrings for each of the methods of this class for more information

Note

While providing an implementation of _connect is technically all that's required to define a valid connection, connections should also provide the user with context-specific ways of interacting with the underlying connection object. For example, the first-party SQLConnection provides a query() method for reads and a session property for more complex operations.

Deprecation notice

st.experimental_memo was deprecated in version 1.18.0. Use st.cache_data instead. Learn more in Caching.

Decorator to cache functions that return data (e.g. dataframe transforms, database queries, ML inference).

Cached objects are stored in "pickled" form, which means that the return value of a cached function must be pickleable. Each caller of the cached function gets its own copy of the cached data.

You can clear a function's cache with func.clear() or clear the entire cache with st.cache_data.clear().

To cache global resources, use st.cache_resource instead. Learn more about caching at https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching.

Function signature
[source]

st.experimental_memo(func=None, *, ttl, max_entries, show_spinner, persist, experimental_allow_widgets, hash_funcs=None)

Parameters

func (callable)

The function to cache. Streamlit hashes the function's source code.

ttl (float, timedelta, str, or None)

The maximum time to keep an entry in the cache. Can be one of:

None if cache entries should never expire (default).
A number specifying the time in seconds.
A string specifying the time in a format supported by Pandas's Timedelta constructor, e.g. "1d", "1.5 days", or "1h23s".
A timedelta object from Python's built-in datetime library, e.g. timedelta(days=1).

Note that ttl will be ignored if persist="disk" or persist=True.

max_entries (int or None)

The maximum number of entries to keep in the cache, or None for an unbounded cache. When a new entry is added to a full cache, the oldest cached entry will be removed. Defaults to None.

show_spinner (bool or str)

Enable the spinner. Default is True to show a spinner when there is a "cache miss" and the cached data is being created. If string, value of show_spinner param will be used for spinner text.

persist ("disk", bool, or None)

Optional location to persist cached data to. Passing "disk" (or True) will persist the cached data to the local disk. None (or False) will disable persistence. The default is None.

experimental_allow_widgets (bool)

Allow widgets to be used in the cached function. Defaults to False. Support for widgets in cached functions is currently experimental. Setting this parameter to True may lead to excessive memory use since the widget value is treated as an additional input parameter to the cache. We may remove support for this option at any time without notice.

hash_funcs (dict or None)

Mapping of types or fully qualified names to hash functions. This is used to override the behavior of the hasher inside Streamlit's caching mechanism: when the hasher encounters an object, it will first check to see if its type matches a key in this dict and, if so, will use the provided function to generate a hash for it. See below for an example of how this can be used.

Example
import streamlit as st

@st.cache_data
def fetch_and_clean_data(url):
    # Fetch data from URL here, and then clean it up.
    return data

d1 = fetch_and_clean_data(DATA_URL_1)
# Actually executes the function, since this is the first time it was
# encountered.

d2 = fetch_and_clean_data(DATA_URL_1)
# Does not execute the function. Instead, returns its previously computed
# value. This means that now the data in d1 is the same as in d2.

d3 = fetch_and_clean_data(DATA_URL_2)
# This is a different URL, so the function executes.
Copy

To set the persist parameter, use this command as follows:

import streamlit as st

@st.cache_data(persist="disk")
def fetch_and_clean_data(url):
    # Fetch data from URL here, and then clean it up.
    return data
Copy

By default, all parameters to a cached function must be hashable. Any parameter whose name begins with _ will not be hashed. You can use this as an "escape hatch" for parameters that are not hashable:

import streamlit as st

@st.cache_data
def fetch_and_clean_data(_db_connection, num_rows):
    # Fetch data from _db_connection here, and then clean it up.
    return data

connection = make_database_connection()
d1 = fetch_and_clean_data(connection, num_rows=10)
# Actually executes the function, since this is the first time it was
# encountered.

another_connection = make_database_connection()
d2 = fetch_and_clean_data(another_connection, num_rows=10)
# Does not execute the function. Instead, returns its previously computed
# value - even though the _database_connection parameter was different
# in both calls.
Copy

A cached function's cache can be procedurally cleared:

import streamlit as st

@st.cache_data
def fetch_and_clean_data(_db_connection, num_rows):
    # Fetch data from _db_connection here, and then clean it up.
    return data

fetch_and_clean_data.clear()
# Clear all cached entries for this function.
Copy

To override the default hashing behavior, pass a custom hash function. You can do that by mapping a type (e.g. datetime.datetime) to a hash function (lambda dt: dt.isoformat()) like this:

import streamlit as st
import datetime

@st.cache_data(hash_funcs={datetime.datetime: lambda dt: dt.isoformat()})
def convert_to_utc(dt: datetime.datetime):
    return dt.astimezone(datetime.timezone.utc)
Copy

Alternatively, you can map the type's fully-qualified name (e.g. "datetime.datetime") to the hash function instead:

import streamlit as st
import datetime

@st.cache_data(hash_funcs={"datetime.datetime": lambda dt: dt.isoformat()})
def convert_to_utc(dt: datetime.datetime):
    return dt.astimezone(datetime.timezone.utc)
Copy

Persistent memo caches currently don't support TTL. ttl will be ignored if persist is specified:

import streamlit as st

@st.experimental_memo(ttl=60, persist="disk")
def load_data():
    return 42

st.write(load_data())


And a warning will be logged to your terminal:

streamlit run app.py

  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.
  Local URL: http://localhost:8501
  Network URL: http://192.168.1.1:8501

2022-09-22 13:35:41.587 The memoized function 'load_data' has a TTL that will be ignored. Persistent memo caches currently don't support TTL.

st.experimental_memo.clear()

Example

In the example below, pressing the "Clear All" button will clear memoized values from all functions decorated with @st.experimental_memo.

import streamlit as st

@st.experimental_memo
def square(x):
    return x**2

@st.experimental_memo
def cube(x):

    st.experimental_memo.clear()

Replay static
st
elements in cache-decorated functions

Functions decorated with @st.experimental_memo can contain static st elements. When a cache-decorated function is executed, we record the element and block messages produced, so the elements will appear in the app even when execution of the function is skipped because the result was cached.

In the example below, the @st.experimental_memo decorator is used to cache the execution of the load_data function, that returns a pandas DataFrame. Notice the cached function also contains a st.area_chart command, which will be replayed when the function is skipped because the result was cached.

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

@st.experimental_memo
def load_data(rows):
    chart_data = pd.DataFrame(
        np.random.randn(rows, 10),
        columns=["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"],
    )
    # Contains a static element st.area_chart
    st.area_chart(chart_data) # This will be recorded and displayed even when the function is skipped
    return chart_data

df = load_data(20)
st.dataframe(df)


Supported static st elements in cache-decorated functions include:

Replay input widgets in cache-decorated functions

In addition to static elements, functions decorated with @st.experimental_memo can also contain input widgets! Replaying input widgets is disabled by default. To enable it, you can set the experimental_allow_widgets parameter for @st.experimental_memo to True. The example below enables widget replaying, and shows the use of a checkbox widget within a cache-decorated function.

import streamlit as st

# Enable widget replay
@st.experimental_memo(experimental_allow_widgets=True)
def func():
    # Contains an input widget
    st.checkbox("Works!")

func()


If the cache decorated function contains input widgets, but experimental_allow_widgets is set to False or unset, Streamlit will throw a CachedStFunctionWarning, like the one below:

import streamlit as st

# Widget replay is disabled by default
@st.experimental_memo
def func():
    # Streamlit will throw a CachedStFunctionWarning
    st.checkbox("Doesn't work")

func()

How widget replay works

Let's demystify how widget replay in cache-decorated functions works and gain a conceptual understanding. Widget values are treated as additional inputs to the function, and are used to determine whether the function should be executed or not. Consider the following example:

import streamlit as st

@st.experimental_memo(experimental_allow_widgets=True)
def plus_one(x):
    y = x + 1
    if st.checkbox("Nuke the value üí•"):
        st.write("Value was nuked, returning 0")
        y = 0
    return y

st.write(plus_one(2))


The plus_one function takes an integer x as input, and returns x + 1. The function also contains a checkbox widget, which is used to "nuke" the value of x. i.e. the return value of plus_one depends on the state of the checkbox: if it is checked, the function returns 0, otherwise it returns 3.

In order to know which value the cache should return (in case of a cache hit), Streamlit treats the checkbox state (checked / unchecked) as an additional input to the function plus_one (just like x). If the user checks the checkbox (thereby changing its state), we look up the cache for the same value of x (2) and the same checkbox state (checked). If the cache contains a value for this combination of inputs, we return it. Otherwise, we execute the function and store the result in the cache.

Let's now understand how enabling and disabling widget replay changes the behavior of the function.

Widget replay disabled
Widgets in cached functions throw a CachedStFunctionWarning and are ignored.
Other static elements in cached functions replay as expected.
Widget replay enabled
Widgets in cached functions don't lead to a warning, and are replayed as expected.
Interacting with a widget in a cached function will cause the function to be executed again, and the cache to be updated.
Widgets in cached functions retain their state across reruns.
Each unique combination of widget values is treated as a separate input to the function, and is used to determine whether the function should be executed or not. i.e. Each unique combination of widget values has its own cache entry; the cached function runs the first time and the saved value is used afterwards.
Calling a cached function multiple times in one script run with the same arguments triggers a DuplicateWidgetID error.
If the arguments to a cached function change, widgets from that function that render again retain their state.
Changing the source code of a cached function invalidates the cache.
Both st.experimental_memo and st.experimental_singleton support widget replay.
Fundamentally, the behavior of a function with (supported) widgets in it doesn't change when it is decorated with @st.experimental_memo or @st.experimental_singleton. The only difference is that the function is only executed when we detect a cache "miss".
Supported widgets

All input widgets are supported in cache-decorated functions. The following is an exhaustive list of supported widgets:

st.button
st.camera_input
st.checkbox
st.color_picker
st.date_input
st.download_button
st.file_uploader
st.multiselect
st.number_input

Configure a progress column in st.dataframe or st.data_editor.

Cells need to contain a number. Progress columns are not editable at the moment. This command needs to be used in the column_config parameter of st.dataframe or st.data_editor.

Function signature
[source]

st.column_config.ProgressColumn(label=None, *, width=None, help=None, format=None, min_value=None, max_value=None)

Parameters

label (str or None)

The label shown at the top of the column. If None (default), the column name is used.

width ("small", "medium", "large", or None)

The display width of the column. Can be one of "small", "medium", or "large". If None (default), the column will be sized to fit the cell contents.

help (str or None)

An optional tooltip that gets displayed when hovering over the column label.

format (str or None)

A printf-style format string controlling how numbers are displayed. Valid formatters: %d %e %f %g %i %u. You can also add prefixes and suffixes, e.g. "$ %.2f" to show a dollar prefix.

min_value (int, float, or None)

The minimum value of the progress bar. If None (default), will be 0.

max_value (int, float, or None)

The minimum value of the progress bar. If None (default), will be 100 for integer values and 1 for float values.

Examples
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

data_df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "sales": [200, 550, 1000, 80],
    }
)

st.data_editor(
    data_df,
    column_config={
        "sales": st.column_config.ProgressColumn(
            "Sales volume",
            help="The sales volume in USD",
            format="$%f",
            min_value=0,
            max_value=1000,
        ),
    },

Deprecation notice

st.connections.SnowParkConnection was deprecated in version 1.28.0. Use st.connections.SnowflakeConnection instead.

A connection to Snowpark using snowflake.snowpark.session.Session. Initialize using

st.connection("<name>", type="snowpark").

In addition to providing access to the Snowpark Session, SnowparkConnection supports direct SQL querying using query("...") and thread safe access using with conn.safe_session():. See methods below for more information. SnowparkConnections should always be created using st.connection(), not initialized directly.

Note

We don't expect this iteration of SnowparkConnection to be able to scale well in apps with many concurrent users due to the lock contention that will occur over the single underlying Session object under high load.

Class description
[source]

st.connections.SnowparkConnection(connection_name, **kwargs)

Methods

query(sql, ttl=None)

Run a read-only SQL query.

reset()

Reset this connection so that it gets reinitialized the next time it's used.

safe_session()

Grab the underlying Snowpark session in a thread-safe manner.

Attributes

session

Access the underlying Snowpark session.

Streamlit in Snowflake

Run a read-only SQL query.

This method implements both query result caching (with caching behavior identical to that of using @st.cache_data) as well as simple error handling/retries.

Note

Queries that are run without a specified ttl are cached indefinitely.

Function signature
[source]

SnowparkConnection.query(sql, ttl=None)

Parameters

sql (str)

The read-only SQL query to execute.

ttl (float, int, timedelta or None)

The maximum number of seconds to keep results in the cache, or None if cached results should not expire. The default is None.

Returns

(pandas.DataFrame)

The result of running the query, formatted as a pandas DataFrame.

import streamlit as st

conn = st.connection("snowpark")
df = conn.query("select * from pet_owners")
st.dataframe(df)

Reset this connection so that it gets reinitialized the next time it's used.

This method can be useful when a connection has become stale, an auth token has expired, or in similar scenarios where a broken connection might be fixed by reinitializing it. Note that some connection methods may already use reset() in their error handling code.

Function signature
[source]

SnowparkConnection.reset()

Example
import streamlit as st

conn = st.connection("my_conn")

# Reset the connection before using it if it isn't healthy
# Note: is_healthy() isn't a real method and is just shown for example here.
if not conn.is_healthy():
    conn.reset()

Grab the underlying Snowpark session in a thread-safe manner.

As operations on a Snowpark session are not thread safe, we need to take care when using a session in the context of a Streamlit app where each script run occurs in its own thread. Using the contextmanager pattern to do this ensures that access on this connection's underlying Session is done in a thread-safe manner.

Information on how to use Snowpark sessions can be found in the Snowpark documentation.

Function signature
[source]

SnowparkConnection.safe_session()

Example
import streamlit as st

conn = st.connection("snowpark")
with conn.safe_session() as session:
    df = session.table("mytable").limit(10).to_pandas()

Access the underlying Snowpark session.

Note

Snowpark sessions are not thread safe. Users of this method are responsible for ensuring that access to the session returned by this method is done in a thread-safe manner. For most users, we recommend using the thread-safe safe_session() method and a with block.

Information on how to use Snowpark sessions can be found in the Snowpark documentation.

Function signature

import streamlit as st

session = st.connection("snowpark").session
df = session.table("mytable").limit(10).to_pandas()

Deprecation notice

st.experimental_connection was deprecated in version 1.28.0. Use st.connection instead.

Create a new connection to a data store or API, or return an existing one.

Config options, credentials, secrets, etc. for connections are taken from various sources:

Any connection-specific configuration files.
An app's secrets.toml files.
The kwargs passed to this function.
Function signature
[source]

st.experimental_connection(name, type=None, max_entries=None, ttl=None, **kwargs)

Parameters

name (str)

The connection name used for secrets lookup in [connections.<name>]. Type will be inferred from passing "sql", "snowflake", or "snowpark".

type (str, connection class, or None)

The type of connection to create. It can be a keyword ("sql", "snowflake", or "snowpark"), a path to an importable class, or an imported class reference. All classes must extend st.connections.BaseConnection and implement the _connect() method. If the type kwarg is None, a type field must be set in the connection's section in secrets.toml.

max_entries (int or None)

The maximum number of connections to keep in the cache, or None for an unbounded cache. (When a new entry is added to a full cache, the oldest cached entry will be removed.) The default is None.

ttl (float, timedelta, or None)

The maximum number of seconds to keep results in the cache, or None if cached results should not expire. The default is None.

**kwargs (any)

Additional connection specific kwargs that are passed to the Connection's _connect() method. Learn more from the specific Connection's documentation.

Returns

(Connection object)

An initialized Connection object of the specified type.

Examples

The easiest way to create a first-party (SQL, Snowflake, or Snowpark) connection is to use their default names and define corresponding sections in your secrets.toml file.

import streamlit as st
conn = st.connection("sql") # Config section defined in [connections.sql] in secrets.toml.
Copy

Creating a SQLConnection with a custom name requires you to explicitly specify the type. If type is not passed as a kwarg, it must be set in the appropriate section of secrets.toml.

import streamlit as st
conn1 = st.connection("my_sql_connection", type="sql") # Config section defined in [connections.my_sql_connection].
conn2 = st.connection("my_other_sql_connection") # type must be set in [connections.my_other_sql_connection].
Copy

Passing the full module path to the connection class that you want to use can be useful, especially when working with a custom connection:

import streamlit as st
conn = st.connection("my_sql_connection", type="streamlit.connections.SQLConnection")
Copy

Finally, you can pass the connection class to use directly to this function. Doing so allows static type checking tools such as mypy to infer the exact return type of st.connection.

import streamlit as st
from streamlit.connections import SQLConnection
conn = st.connection("my_sql_connection", type=SQLConnection)
Copy

For a comprehensive overview of this feature, check out this video tutorial by Joshua Carroll, Streamlit's Product Manager for Developer Experience. You'll learn about the feature's utility in creating and managing data connections within your apps by using real-world examples.

Streamlit in Snowflake

Insert containers separated into tabs.

Inserts a number of multi-element containers as tabs. Tabs are a navigational element that allows users to easily move between groups of related content.

To add elements to the returned containers, you can use "with" notation (preferred) or just call methods directly on the returned object. See examples below.

Warning

All the content of every tab is always sent to and rendered on the frontend. Conditional rendering is currently not supported.

Function signature
[source]

st.tabs(tabs)

Parameters

tabs (list of str)

Creates a tab for each string in the list. The first tab is selected by default. The string is used as the name of the tab and can optionally contain Markdown, supporting the following elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, Emojis, and Links.

This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1: and :sunglasses:. For a list of all supported codes, see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Display unsupported elements as literal characters by backslash-escaping them. E.g. 1\. Not an ordered list.

Returns

(list of containers)

A list of container objects.

Examples

You can use with notation to insert any element into a tab:

import streamlit as st

tab1, tab2, tab3 = st.tabs(["Cat", "Dog", "Owl"])

with tab1:
   st.header("A cat")
   st.image("https://static.streamlit.io/examples/cat.jpg", width=200)

with tab2:
   st.header("A dog")
   st.image("https://static.streamlit.io/examples/dog.jpg", width=200)

with tab3:
   st.header("An owl")
   st.image("https://static.streamlit.io/examples/owl.jpg", width=200)
Copy

Or you can just call methods directly in the returned objects:

import streamlit as st
import numpy as np

tab1, tab2 = st.tabs(["üìà Chart", "üóÉ Data"])
data = np.random.randn(10, 1)

tab1.subheader("A tab with a chart")
tab1.line_chart(data)

tab2.subheader("A tab with the data")
tab2.write(data)

st.cache
st.cache

When you mark a function with Streamlit‚Äôs cache annotation, it tells Streamlit that whenever the function is called it should check three things:

The name of the function
The actual code that makes up the body of the function
The input parameters that you called the function with

If this is the first time Streamlit has seen those three items, with those exact values, and in that exact combination, it runs the function and stores the result in a local cache.

Then, next time the function is called, if those three values have not changed Streamlit knows it can skip executing the function altogether. Instead, it just reads the output from the local cache and passes it on to the caller.

The main limitation is that Streamlit‚Äôs cache feature doesn‚Äôt know about changes that take place outside the body of the annotated function.

For more information about the Streamlit cache, its configuration parameters, and its limitations, see Caching.

Deprecation notice

st.cache was deprecated in version 1.18.0. Use st.cache_data or st.cache_resource instead. Learn more in Caching.

Function decorator to memoize function executions.

Function signature
[source]

st.cache(func=None, persist=False, allow_output_mutation=False, show_spinner=True, suppress_st_warning=False, hash_funcs=None, max_entries=None, ttl=None)

Parameters

func (callable)

The function to cache. Streamlit hashes the function and dependent code.

persist (bool)

Whether to persist the cache on disk.

allow_output_mutation (bool)

Streamlit shows a warning when return values are mutated, as that can have unintended consequences. This is done by hashing the return value internally.

If you know what you're doing and would like to override this warning, set this to True.

show_spinner (bool)

Enable the spinner. Default is True to show a spinner when there is a cache miss.

suppress_st_warning (bool)

Suppress warnings about calling Streamlit commands from within the cached function.

hash_funcs (dict or None)

Mapping of types or fully qualified names to hash functions. This is used to override the behavior of the hasher inside Streamlit's caching mechanism: when the hasher encounters an object, it will first check to see if its type matches a key in this dict and, if so, will use the provided function to generate a hash for it. See below for an example of how this can be used.

max_entries (int or None)

The maximum number of entries to keep in the cache, or None for an unbounded cache. (When a new entry is added to a full cache, the oldest cached entry will be removed.) The default is None.

ttl (float or None)

The maximum number of seconds to keep an entry in the cache, or None if cache entries should not expire. The default is None.

Example
import streamlit as st

@st.cache
def fetch_and_clean_data(url):
    # Fetch data from URL here, and then clean it up.
    return data

d1 = fetch_and_clean_data(DATA_URL_1)
# Actually executes the function, since this is the first time it was
# encountered.

d2 = fetch_and_clean_data(DATA_URL_1)
# Does not execute the function. Instead, returns its previously computed
# value. This means that now the data in d1 is the same as in d2.

d3 = fetch_and_clean_data(DATA_URL_2)
# This is a different URL, so the function executes.
Copy

To set the persist parameter, use this command as follows:

@st.cache(persist=True)
def fetch_and_clean_data(url):
    # Fetch data from URL here, and then clean it up.
    return data
Copy

To disable hashing return values, set the allow_output_mutation parameter to True:

@st.cache(allow_output_mutation=True)
def fetch_and_clean_data(url):
    # Fetch data from URL here, and then clean it up.
    return data
Copy

To override the default hashing behavior, pass a custom hash function. You can do that by mapping a type (e.g. MongoClient) to a hash function (id) like this:

@st.cache(hash_funcs={MongoClient: id})
def connect_to_database(url):
    return MongoClient(url)
Copy

Alternatively, you can map the type's fully-qualified name (e.g. "pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient") to the hash function instead:

@st.cache(hash_funcs={"pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient": id})
def connect_to_database(url):
    return MongoClient(url)
Copy
priority_high
Warning

st.cache implicitly uses the pickle module, which is known to be insecure. Anything your cached function returns is pickled and stored, then unpickled on retrieval. Ensure your cached functions return trusted values because it is possible to construct malicious pickle data that will execute arbitrary code during unpickling. Never load data that could have come from an untrusted source in an unsafe mode or that could have been tampered with. Only load data you trust.

Deploy Streamlit using Docker
Introduction

So you have an amazing app and you want to start sharing it with other people, what do you do? You have a few options. First, where do you want to run your Streamlit app, and how do you want to access it?

On your corporate network¬†- Most corporate networks are closed to the outside world. You typically use a VPN to log onto your corporate network and access resources there. You could run your Streamlit app on a server in your corporate network for security reasons, to ensure that only folks internal to your company can access it.
On the cloud¬†- If you'd like to access your Streamlit app from outside of a corporate network, or share your app with folks outside of your home network or laptop, you might choose this option. In this case, it'll depend on your hosting provider. We have community-submitted guides from Heroku, AWS, and other providers.

Wherever you decide to deploy your app, you will first need to containerize it. This guide walks you through using Docker to deploy your app. If you prefer Kubernetes see Deploy Streamlit using Kubernetes.

Prerequisites
Install Docker Engine
Check network port accessibility
Install Docker Engine

If you haven't already done so, install Docker on your server. Docker provides¬†.deb and¬†.rpm packages from many Linux distributions, including:

Debian
Ubuntu

Verify that Docker Engine is installed correctly by running the¬†hello-world Docker image:

sudo docker run hello-world

star
Tip

Follow Docker's official post-installation steps for Linux to run Docker as a non-root user, so that you don't have to preface the docker command with sudo.

Check network port accessibility

As you and your users are behind your corporate VPN, you need to make sure all of you can access a certain network port. Let's say port 8501, as it is the default port used by Streamlit. Contact your IT team and request access to port 8501 for you and your users.

Create a Dockerfile

Docker builds images by reading the instructions from a¬†Dockerfile. A¬†Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Learn more in the Dockerfile reference. The¬†docker build command builds an image from a¬†Dockerfile. The docker run command first creates a container over the specified image, and then starts it using the specified command.

Here's an example Dockerfile that you can add to the root of your directory. i.e. in /app/

# app/Dockerfile

FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    curl \
    software-properties-common \
    git \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN git clone https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit-example.git .

RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

EXPOSE 8501

HEALTHCHECK CMD curl --fail http://localhost:8501/_stcore/health

ENTRYPOINT ["streamlit", "run", "streamlit_app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]

Dockerfile walkthrough

Let‚Äôs walk through each line of the Dockerfile :

A Dockerfile must start with a¬†FROM instruction. It sets the Base Image (think OS) for the container:

FROM python:3.9-slim


Docker has a number of official Docker base images based on various Linux distributions. They also have base images that come with language-specific modules such as Python. The python images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case. Here, we use the python:3.9-slim image which is a lightweight image that comes with the latest version of Python 3.9.

star
Tip

You can also use your own base image, provided the image you use contains a supported version of Python for Streamlit. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to using any specific base image, nor is there an official Streamlit-specific base image.

The¬†WORKDIR instruction sets the working directory for any¬†RUN,¬†CMD,¬†ENTRYPOINT,¬†COPY and¬†ADD instructions that follow it in the¬†Dockerfile . Let‚Äôs set it to app/ :

WORKDIR /app

priority_high
Important

As mentioned in Development flow, for Streamlit version 1.10.0 and higher, Streamlit apps cannot be run from the root directory of Linux distributions. Your main script should live in a directory other than the root directory. If you try to run a Streamlit app from the root directory, Streamlit will throw a FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory error. For more information, see GitHub issue #5239.

If you are using Streamlit version 1.10.0 or higher, you must set the WORKDIR to a directory other than the root directory. For example, you can set the WORKDIR to /app as shown in the example Dockerfile above.

Install git so that we can clone the app code from a remote repo:

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    curl \
    software-properties-common \
    git \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*


Clone your code that lives in a remote repo to WORKDIR:

a. If your code is in a public repo:

RUN git clone https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit-example.git .


Once cloned, the directory of WORKDIR will look like the following:

app/
- requirements.txt
- streamlit_app.py


where requirements.txt file contains all your Python dependencies. E.g

altair
pandas
streamlit


and streamlit_app.py is your main script. E.g.

from collections import namedtuple
import altair as alt
import math
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

"""
# Welcome to Streamlit!

Edit `/streamlit_app.py` to customize this app to your heart's desire :heart:

If you have any questions, checkout our [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io) and [community
forums](https://discuss.streamlit.io).

In the meantime, below is an example of what you can do with just a few lines of code:
"""

with st.echo(code_location='below'):
   total_points = st.slider("Number of points in spiral", 1, 5000, 2000)
   num_turns = st.slider("Number of turns in spiral", 1, 100, 9)

   Point = namedtuple('Point', 'x y')
   data = []

   points_per_turn = total_points / num_turns

   for curr_point_num in range(total_points):
      curr_turn, i = divmod(curr_point_num, points_per_turn)
      angle = (curr_turn + 1) * 2 * math.pi * i / points_per_turn
      radius = curr_point_num / total_points
      x = radius * math.cos(angle)
      y = radius * math.sin(angle)
      data.append(Point(x, y))

   st.altair_chart(alt.Chart(pd.DataFrame(data), height=500, width=500)
      .mark_circle(color='#0068c9', opacity=0.5)
      .encode(x='x:Q', y='y:Q'))


b. If your code is in a private repo, please read Using SSH to access private data in builds and modify the Dockerfile accordingly -- to install an SSH client, download the public key for github.com, and clone your private repo. If you use an alternative VCS such as GitLab or Bitbucket, please consult the documentation for that VCS on how to copy your code to the WORKDIR of the Dockerfile.

c. If your code lives in the same directory as the Dockerfile, copy all your app files from your server into the container, including streamlit_app.py, requirements.txt, etc, by replacing the git clone line with:

COPY . .


More generally, the idea is copy your app code from wherever it may live on your server into the container. If the code is not in the same directory as the Dockerfile, modify the above command to include the path to the code.

Install your app‚Äôs Python dependencies from the cloned requirements.txt in the container:

RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt


The¬†EXPOSE instruction informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. Your container needs to listen to Streamlit‚Äôs (default) port 8501:

EXPOSE 8501


The¬†HEALTHCHECK instruction tells Docker how to test a container to check that it is still working. Your container needs to listen to Streamlit‚Äôs (default) port 8501:

HEALTHCHECK CMD curl --fail http://localhost:8501/_stcore/health


An¬†ENTRYPOINT¬†allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable. Here, it also contains the entire streamlit run command for your app, so you don‚Äôt have to call it from the command line:

ENTRYPOINT ["streamlit", "run", "streamlit_app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]

Build a Docker image

The¬†docker build command builds an image from a¬†Dockerfile . Run the following command from the app/ directory on your server to build the image:

docker build -t streamlit .


The -t flag is used to tag the image. Here, we have tagged the image streamlit. If you run:

docker images


You should see a streamlit image under the REPOSITORY column. For example:

REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED              SIZE
streamlit    latest    70b0759a094d   About a minute ago   1.02GB

Run the Docker container

Now that you have built the image, you can run the container by executing:

docker run -p 8501:8501 streamlit


The -p flag publishes the container‚Äôs port 8501 to your server‚Äôs 8501 port.

If all went well, you should see an output similar to the following:

docker run -p 8501:8501 streamlit

  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

  URL: http://0.0.0.0:8501


To view your app, users can browse to http://0.0.0.0:8501 or http://localhost:8501

push_pin
Note

Based on your server's network configuration, you could map to port 80/443 so that users can view your app using the server IP or hostname. For example: http://your-server-ip:80 or http://your-hostname:443.

Streamlit in Snowflake

Configure a bar chart column in st.dataframe or st.data_editor.

Cells need to contain a list of numbers. Chart columns are not editable at the moment. This command needs to be used in the column_config parameter of st.dataframe or st.data_editor.

Function signature
[source]

st.column_config.BarChartColumn(label=None, *, width=None, help=None, y_min=None, y_max=None)

Parameters

label (str or None)

The label shown at the top of the column. If None (default), the column name is used.

width ("small", "medium", "large", or None)

The display width of the column. Can be one of "small", "medium", or "large". If None (default), the column will be sized to fit the cell contents.

help (str or None)

An optional tooltip that gets displayed when hovering over the column label.

y_min (int, float, or None)

The minimum value on the y-axis for all cells in the column. If None (default), every cell will use the minimum of its data.

y_max (int, float, or None)

The maximum value on the y-axis for all cells in the column. If None (default), every cell will use the maximum of its data.

Examples
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

data_df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "sales": [
            [0, 4, 26, 80, 100, 40],
            [80, 20, 80, 35, 40, 100],
            [10, 20, 80, 80, 70, 0],
            [10, 100, 20, 100, 30, 100],
        ],
    }
)

st.data_editor(

Streamlit in Snowflake

Configure a datetime column in st.dataframe or st.data_editor.

This is the default column type for datetime values. This command needs to be used in the column_config parameter of st.dataframe or st.data_editor. When used with st.data_editor, editing will be enabled with a datetime picker widget.

Function signature
[source]

st.column_config.DatetimeColumn(label=None, *, width=None, help=None, disabled=None, required=None, default=None, format=None, min_value=None, max_value=None, step=None, timezone=None)

Parameters

label (str or None)

The label shown at the top of the column. If None (default), the column name is used.

width ("small", "medium", "large", or None)

The display width of the column. Can be one of "small", "medium", or "large". If None (default), the column will be sized to fit the cell contents.

help (str or None)

An optional tooltip that gets displayed when hovering over the column label.

disabled (bool or None)

Whether editing should be disabled for this column. Defaults to False.

required (bool or None)

Whether edited cells in the column need to have a value. If True, an edited cell can only be submitted if it has a value other than None. Defaults to False.

default (datetime.datetime or None)

Specifies the default value in this column when a new row is added by the user.

format (str or None)

A momentJS format string controlling how datetimes are displayed. See momentJS docs for available formats. If None (default), uses YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.

min_value (datetime.datetime or None)

The minimum datetime that can be entered. If None (default), there will be no minimum.

max_value (datetime.datetime or None)

The maximum datetime that can be entered. If None (default), there will be no maximum.

step (int, float, datetime.timedelta, or None)

The stepping interval in seconds. If None (default), the step will be 1 second.

timezone (str or None)

The timezone of this column. If None (default), the timezone is inferred from the underlying data.

Examples
from datetime import datetime
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

data_df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "appointment": [
            datetime(2024, 2, 5, 12, 30),
            datetime(2023, 11, 10, 18, 0),
            datetime(2024, 3, 11, 20, 10),
            datetime(2023, 9, 12, 3, 0),
        ]
    }
)

st.data_editor(
    data_df,
    column_config={
        "appointment": st.column_config.DatetimeColumn(
            "Appointment",
            min_value=datetime(2023, 6, 1),
            max_value=datetime(2025, 1, 1),
            format="D MMM YYYY, h:mm a",
            step=60,
        ),
    },

Streamlit in Snowflake

Insert containers laid out as side-by-side columns.

Inserts a number of multi-element containers laid out side-by-side and returns a list of container objects.

To add elements to the returned containers, you can use "with" notation (preferred) or just call methods directly on the returned object. See examples below.

Columns can only be placed inside other columns up to one level of nesting.

Warning

Columns cannot be placed inside other columns in the sidebar. This is only possible in the main area of the app.

Function signature
[source]

st.columns(spec, *, gap="small")

Parameters

spec (int or Iterable of numbers)

Controls the number and width of columns to insert. Can be one of:

An integer that specifies the number of columns. All columns have equal width in this case.
An Iterable of numbers (int or float) that specify the relative width of each column. E.g. [0.7, 0.3] creates two columns where the first one takes up 70% of the available with and the second one takes up 30%. Or [1, 2, 3] creates three columns where the second one is two times the width of the first one, and the third one is three times that width.

gap ("small", "medium", or "large")

The size of the gap between the columns. Defaults to "small".

Returns

(list of containers)

A list of container objects.

Examples

You can use with notation to insert any element into a column:

import streamlit as st

col1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)

with col1:
   st.header("A cat")
   st.image("https://static.streamlit.io/examples/cat.jpg")

with col2:
   st.header("A dog")
   st.image("https://static.streamlit.io/examples/dog.jpg")

with col3:
   st.header("An owl")
   st.image("https://static.streamlit.io/examples/owl.jpg")
Copy

Or you can just call methods directly in the returned objects:

import streamlit as st
import numpy as np

col1, col2 = st.columns([3, 1])
data = np.random.randn(10, 1)

col1.subheader("A wide column with a chart")
col1.line_chart(data)

col2.subheader("A narrow column with the data")
col2.write(data)

[source]

st.audio(data, format="audio/wav", start_time=0, *, sample_rate=None)

Parameters

data (str, bytes, BytesIO, numpy.ndarray, or file)

Raw audio data, filename, or a URL pointing to the file to load. Raw data formats must include all necessary file headers to match the file format specified via format. If data is a numpy array, it must either be a 1D array of the waveform or a 2D array of shape (num_channels, num_samples) with waveforms for all channels. See the default channel order at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn653308(v=vs.85).aspx

format (str)

The mime type for the audio file. Defaults to 'audio/wav'. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4281 for more info.

start_time (int)

The time from which this element should start playing.

sample_rate (int or None)

The sample rate of the audio data in samples per second. Only required if data is a numpy array.

Example
import streamlit as st
import numpy as np

audio_file = open('myaudio.ogg', 'rb')
audio_bytes = audio_file.read()

st.audio(audio_bytes, format='audio/ogg')

sample_rate = 44100  # 44100 samples per second
seconds = 2  # Note duration of 2 seconds
frequency_la = 440  # Our played note will be 440 Hz
# Generate array with seconds*sample_rate steps, ranging between 0 and seconds
t = np.linspace(0, seconds, seconds * sample_rate, False)
# Generate a 440 Hz sine wave
note_la = np.sin(frequency_la * t * 2 * np.pi)

st.audio(note_la, sample_rate=sample_rate)

Display a date input widget.

Function signature
[source]

st.date_input(label, value="today", min_value=None, max_value=None, key=None, help=None, on_change=None, args=None, kwargs=None, *, format="YYYY/MM/DD", disabled=False, label_visibility="visible")

Parameters

label (str)

A short label explaining to the user what this date input is for. The label can optionally contain Markdown and supports the following elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, Emojis, and Links.

This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1: and :sunglasses:. For a list of all supported codes, see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Display unsupported elements as literal characters by backslash-escaping them. E.g. 1\. Not an ordered list.

For accessibility reasons, you should never set an empty label (label="") but hide it with label_visibility if needed. In the future, we may disallow empty labels by raising an exception.

value (datetime.date or datetime.datetime or list/tuple of datetime.date or datetime.datetime, "today", or None)

The value of this widget when it first renders. If a list/tuple with 0 to 2 date/datetime values is provided, the datepicker will allow users to provide a range. If None, will initialize empty and return None until the user provides input. If "today" (default), will initialize with today as a single-date picker.

min_value (datetime.date or datetime.datetime)

The minimum selectable date. If value is a date, defaults to value - 10 years. If value is the interval [start, end], defaults to start - 10 years.

max_value (datetime.date or datetime.datetime)

The maximum selectable date. If value is a date, defaults to value + 10 years. If value is the interval [start, end], defaults to end + 10 years.

key (str or int)

An optional string or integer to use as the unique key for the widget. If this is omitted, a key will be generated for the widget based on its content. Multiple widgets of the same type may not share the same key.

help (str)

An optional tooltip that gets displayed next to the input.

on_change (callable)

An optional callback invoked when this date_input's value changes.

args (tuple)

An optional tuple of args to pass to the callback.

kwargs (dict)

An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback.

format (str)

A format string controlling how the interface should display dates. Supports ‚ÄúYYYY/MM/DD‚Äù (default), ‚ÄúDD/MM/YYYY‚Äù, or ‚ÄúMM/DD/YYYY‚Äù. You may also use a period (.) or hyphen (-) as separators.

disabled (bool)

An optional boolean, which disables the date input if set to True. The default is False.

label_visibility ("visible", "hidden", or "collapsed")

The visibility of the label. If "hidden", the label doesn't show but there is still empty space for it above the widget (equivalent to label=""). If "collapsed", both the label and the space are removed. Default is "visible".

Returns

(datetime.date or a tuple with 0-2 dates or None)

The current value of the date input widget or None if no date has been selected.

Examples
import datetime
import streamlit as st

d = st.date_input("When's your birthday", datetime.date(2019, 7, 6))
st.write('Your birthday is:', d)
Copy
import datetime
import streamlit as st

today = datetime.datetime.now()
next_year = today.year + 1
jan_1 = datetime.date(next_year, 1, 1)
dec_31 = datetime.date(next_year, 12, 31)

d = st.date_input(
    "Select your vacation for next year",
    (jan_1, datetime.date(next_year, 1, 7)),
    jan_1,
    dec_31,
    format="MM.DD.YYYY",
)
d
Copy

To initialize an empty date input, use None as the value:

import datetime
import streamlit as st

d = st.date_input("When's your birthday", value=None)
st.write('Your birthday is:', d)
Copy

Display a video player.

Function signature
[source]

st.video(data, format="video/mp4", start_time=0)

Parameters

data (str, bytes, BytesIO, numpy.ndarray, or file)

Raw video data, filename, or URL pointing to a video to load. Includes support for YouTube URLs. Numpy arrays and raw data formats must include all necessary file headers to match specified file format.

format (str)

The mime type for the video file. Defaults to 'video/mp4'. See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4281 for more info.

start_time (int)

The time from which this element should start playing.

Example
import streamlit as st

video_file = open('myvideo.mp4', 'rb')
video_bytes = video_file.read()

st.video(video_bytes)
Copy

Note

Some videos may not display if they are encoded using MP4V (which is an export option in OpenCV), as this codec is not widely supported by browsers. Converting your video to H.264 will allow the video to be displayed in Streamlit. See this StackOverflow post or this Streamlit forum post for more information.

Display a color picker widget.

Function signature
[source]

st.color_picker(label, value=None, key=None, help=None, on_change=None, args=None, kwargs=None, *, disabled=False, label_visibility="visible")

Parameters

label (str)

A short label explaining to the user what this input is for. The label can optionally contain Markdown and supports the following elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, Emojis, and Links.

This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1: and :sunglasses:. For a list of all supported codes, see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Display unsupported elements as literal characters by backslash-escaping them. E.g. 1\. Not an ordered list.

For accessibility reasons, you should never set an empty label (label="") but hide it with label_visibility if needed. In the future, we may disallow empty labels by raising an exception.

value (str)

The hex value of this widget when it first renders. If None, defaults to black.

key (str or int)

An optional string or integer to use as the unique key for the widget. If this is omitted, a key will be generated for the widget based on its content. Multiple widgets of the same type may not share the same key.

help (str)

An optional tooltip that gets displayed next to the color picker.

on_change (callable)

An optional callback invoked when this color_picker's value changes.

args (tuple)

An optional tuple of args to pass to the callback.

kwargs (dict)

An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback.

disabled (bool)

An optional boolean, which disables the color picker if set to True. The default is False. This argument can only be supplied by keyword.

label_visibility ("visible", "hidden", or "collapsed")

The visibility of the label. If "hidden", the label doesn't show but there is still empty space for it above the widget (equivalent to label=""). If "collapsed", both the label and the space are removed. Default is "visible".

Returns

(str)

The selected color as a hex string.

Example
import streamlit as st

color = st.color_picker('Pick A Color', '#00f900')
st.write('The current color is', color)

Display an image or list of images.

Function signature
[source]

st.image(image, caption=None, width=None, use_column_width=None, clamp=False, channels="RGB", output_format="auto")

Parameters

image (numpy.ndarray, [numpy.ndarray], BytesIO, str, or [str])

Monochrome image of shape (w,h) or (w,h,1) OR a color image of shape (w,h,3) OR an RGBA image of shape (w,h,4) OR a URL to fetch the image from OR a path of a local image file OR an SVG XML string like <svg xmlns=...</svg> OR a list of one of the above, to display multiple images.

caption (str or list of str)

Image caption. If displaying multiple images, caption should be a list of captions (one for each image).

width (int or None)

Image width. None means use the image width, but do not exceed the width of the column. Should be set for SVG images, as they have no default image width.

use_column_width ("auto", "always", "never", or bool)

If "auto", set the image's width to its natural size, but do not exceed the width of the column. If "always" or True, set the image's width to the column width. If "never" or False, set the image's width to its natural size. Note: if set, use_column_width takes precedence over the width parameter.

clamp (bool)

Clamp image pixel values to a valid range ([0-255] per channel). This is only meaningful for byte array images; the parameter is ignored for image URLs. If this is not set, and an image has an out-of-range value, an error will be thrown.

channels ("RGB" or "BGR")

If image is an nd.array, this parameter denotes the format used to represent color information. Defaults to "RGB", meaning image[:, :, 0] is the red channel, image[:, :, 1] is green, and image[:, :, 2] is blue. For images coming from libraries like OpenCV you should set this to "BGR", instead.

output_format ("JPEG", "PNG", or "auto")

This parameter specifies the format to use when transferring the image data. Photos should use the JPEG format for lossy compression while diagrams should use the PNG format for lossless compression. Defaults to "auto" which identifies the compression type based on the type and format of the image argument.

Example
import streamlit as st
st.image('sunrise.jpg', caption='Sunrise by the mountains')

st.time_input(label, value="now", key=None, help=None, on_change=None, args=None, kwargs=None, *, disabled=False, label_visibility="visible", step=0:15:00)

Parameters

label (str)

A short label explaining to the user what this time input is for. The label can optionally contain Markdown and supports the following elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, Emojis, and Links.

This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1: and :sunglasses:. For a list of all supported codes, see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Display unsupported elements as literal characters by backslash-escaping them. E.g. 1\. Not an ordered list.

For accessibility reasons, you should never set an empty label (label="") but hide it with label_visibility if needed. In the future, we may disallow empty labels by raising an exception.

value (datetime.time/datetime.datetime, "now" or None)

An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback.

disabled (bool)

An optional boolean, which disables the time input if set to True. The default is False.

label_visibility ("visible", "hidden", or "collapsed")

The visibility of the label. If "hidden", the label doesn't show but there is still empty space for it above the widget (equivalent to label=""). If "collapsed", both the label and the space are removed. Default is "visible".

step (int or timedelta)

The stepping interval in seconds. Defaults to 900, i.e. 15 minutes. You can also pass a datetime.timedelta object.

Returns

(datetime.time or None)

The current value of the time input widget or None if no time has been selected.

Example
import datetime
import streamlit as st

t = st.time_input('Set an alarm for', datetime.time(8, 45))
st.write('Alarm is set for', t)
Copy

To initialize an empty time input, use None as the value:

import datetime
import streamlit as st

t = st.time_input('Set an alarm for', value=None)
st.write('Alarm is set for', t)
Copy

Add widgets to sidebar

Not only can you add interactivity to your app with widgets, you can organize them into a sidebar. Elements can be passed to st.sidebar using object notation and with notation.

The following two snippets are equivalent:

# Object notation
st.sidebar.[element_name]

# "with" notation
with st.sidebar:
    st.[element_name]


Each element that's passed to st.sidebar is pinned to the left, allowing users to focus on the content in your app.

star
Tip

The sidebar is resizable! Drag and drop the right border of the sidebar to resize it! ‚ÜîÔ∏è

Here's an example of how you'd add a selectbox and a radio button to your sidebar:

import streamlit as st

# Using object notation
add_selectbox = st.sidebar.selectbox(
    "How would you like to be contacted?",
    ("Email", "Home phone", "Mobile phone")
)

# Using "with" notation
with st.sidebar:
    add_radio = st.radio(
        "Choose a shipping method",
        ("Standard (5-15 days)", "Express (2-5 days)")
    )

priority_high
Important

The only elements that aren't supported using object notation are st.echo, st.spinner, and st.toast. To use these elements, you must use with notation.

Here's an example of how you'd add st.echo and st.spinner to your sidebar:

import streamlit as st

with st.sidebar:
    with st.echo():
        st.write("This code will be printed to the sidebar.")

    with st.spinner("Loading..."):
        time.sleep(5)
    st.success("Done!")

Display a file uploader widget.

By default, uploaded files are limited to 200MB. You can configure this using the server.maxUploadSize config option. For more info on how to set config options, see https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/configuration#set-configuration-options

Function signature
[source]

st.file_uploader(label, type=None, accept_multiple_files=False, key=None, help=None, on_change=None, args=None, kwargs=None, *, disabled=False, label_visibility="visible")

Parameters

label (str)

A short label explaining to the user what this file uploader is for. The label can optionally contain Markdown and supports the following elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, Emojis, and Links.

This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1: and :sunglasses:. For a list of all supported codes, see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Display unsupported elements as literal characters by backslash-escaping them. E.g. 1\. Not an ordered list.

For accessibility reasons, you should never set an empty label (label="") but hide it with label_visibility if needed. In the future, we may disallow empty labels by raising an exception.

type (str or list of str or None)

Array of allowed extensions. ['png', 'jpg'] The default is None, which means all extensions are allowed.

accept_multiple_files (bool)

If True, allows the user to upload multiple files at the same time, in which case the return value will be a list of files. Default: False

key (str or int)

An optional string or integer to use as the unique key for the widget. If this is omitted, a key will be generated for the widget based on its content. Multiple widgets of the same type may not share the same key.

help (str)

A tooltip that gets displayed next to the file uploader.

on_change (callable)

An optional callback invoked when this file_uploader's value changes.

args (tuple)

An optional tuple of args to pass to the callback.

kwargs (dict)

An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback.

disabled (bool)

An optional boolean, which disables the file uploader if set to True. The default is False. This argument can only be supplied by keyword.

label_visibility ("visible", "hidden", or "collapsed")

The visibility of the label. If "hidden", the label doesn't show but there is still empty space for it above the widget (equivalent to label=""). If "collapsed", both the label and the space are removed. Default is "visible".

Returns

(None or UploadedFile or list of UploadedFile)

If accept_multiple_files is False, returns either None or an UploadedFile object.
If accept_multiple_files is True, returns a list with the uploaded files as UploadedFile objects. If no files were uploaded, returns an empty list.

The UploadedFile class is a subclass of BytesIO, and therefore it is "file-like". This means you can pass them anywhere where a file is expected.

Examples

Insert a file uploader that accepts a single file at a time:

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
from io import StringIO

uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Choose a file")
if uploaded_file is not None:
    # To read file as bytes:
    bytes_data = uploaded_file.getvalue()
    st.write(bytes_data)

    # To convert to a string based IO:
    stringio = StringIO(uploaded_file.getvalue().decode("utf-8"))
    st.write(stringio)

    # To read file as string:
    string_data = stringio.read()
    st.write(string_data)

    # Can be used wherever a "file-like" object is accepted:
    dataframe = pd.read_csv(uploaded_file)
    st.write(dataframe)
Copy

Insert a file uploader that accepts multiple files at a time:

import streamlit as st

uploaded_files = st.file_uploader("Choose a CSV file", accept_multiple_files=True)
for uploaded_file in uploaded_files:
    bytes_data = uploaded_file.read()
    st.write("filename:", uploaded_file.name)
    st.write(bytes_data)
Copy

Display a numeric input widget.

Note

Integer values exceeding +/- (1<<53) - 1 cannot be accurately stored or returned by the widget due to serialization contstraints between the Python server and JavaScript client. You must handle such numbers as floats, leading to a loss in precision.

Function signature
[source]

st.number_input(label, min_value=None, max_value=None, value="min", step=None, format=None, key=None, help=None, on_change=None, args=None, kwargs=None, *, placeholder=None, disabled=False, label_visibility="visible")

Parameters

label (str)

A short label explaining to the user what this input is for. The label can optionally contain Markdown and supports the following elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, Emojis, and Links.

This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1: and :sunglasses:. For a list of all supported codes, see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Display unsupported elements as literal characters by backslash-escaping them. E.g. 1\. Not an ordered list.

For accessibility reasons, you should never set an empty label (label="") but hide it with label_visibility if needed. In the future, we may disallow empty labels by raising an exception.

min_value (int, float, or None)

The minimum permitted value. If None, there will be no minimum.

max_value (int, float, or None)

The maximum permitted value. If None, there will be no maximum.

value (int, float, "min" or None)

The value of this widget when it first renders. If None, will initialize empty and return None until the user provides input. If "min" (default), will initialize with min_value, or 0.0 if min_value is None.

step (int, float, or None)

The stepping interval. Defaults to 1 if the value is an int, 0.01 otherwise. If the value is not specified, the format parameter will be used.

format (str or None)

A printf-style format string controlling how the interface should display numbers. Output must be purely numeric. This does not impact the return value. Valid formatters: %d %e %f %g %i %u

key (str or int)

An optional string or integer to use as the unique key for the widget. If this is omitted, a key will be generated for the widget based on its content. Multiple widgets of the same type may not share the same key.

help (str)

An optional tooltip that gets displayed next to the input.

on_change (callable)

An optional callback invoked when this number_input's value changes.

args (tuple)

An optional tuple of args to pass to the callback.

kwargs (dict)

An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback.

placeholder (str or None)

An optional string displayed when the number input is empty. If None, no placeholder is displayed.

disabled (bool)

An optional boolean, which disables the number input if set to True. The default is False.

label_visibility ("visible", "hidden", or "collapsed")

The visibility of the label. If "hidden", the label doesn't show but there is still empty space for it above the widget (equivalent to label=""). If "collapsed", both the label and the space are removed. Default is "visible".

Returns

(int or float or None)

The current value of the numeric input widget or None if the widget is empty. The return type will match the data type of the value parameter.

Example
import streamlit as st

number = st.number_input('Insert a number')
st.write('The current number is ', number)
Copy

To initialize an empty number input, use None as the value:

import streamlit as st

number = st.number_input("Insert a number", value=None, placeholder="Type a number...")
st.write('The current number is ', number)
Copy

Display a slider widget to select items from a list.

This also allows you to render a range slider by passing a two-element tuple or list as the value.

The difference between st.select_slider and st.slider is that select_slider accepts any datatype and takes an iterable set of options, while st.slider only accepts numerical or date/time data and takes a range as input.

Function signature
[source]

st.select_slider(label, options=(), value=None, format_func=special_internal_function, key=None, help=None, on_change=None, args=None, kwargs=None, *, disabled=False, label_visibility="visible")

Parameters

label (str)

A short label explaining to the user what this slider is for. The label can optionally contain Markdown and supports the following elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, Emojis, and Links.

This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1: and :sunglasses:. For a list of all supported codes, see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Display unsupported elements as literal characters by backslash-escaping them. E.g. 1\. Not an ordered list.

For accessibility reasons, you should never set an empty label (label="") but hide it with label_visibility if needed. In the future, we may disallow empty labels by raising an exception.

options (Iterable)

Labels for the select options in an Iterable. For example, this can be a list, numpy.ndarray, pandas.Series, pandas.DataFrame, or pandas.Index. For pandas.DataFrame, the first column is used. Each label will be cast to str internally by default.

value (a supported type or a tuple/list of supported types or None)

The value of the slider when it first renders. If a tuple/list of two values is passed here, then a range slider with those lower and upper bounds is rendered. For example, if set to (1, 10) the slider will have a selectable range between 1 and 10. Defaults to first option.

format_func (function)

Function to modify the display of the labels from the options. argument. It receives the option as an argument and its output will be cast to str.

key (str or int)

An optional string or integer to use as the unique key for the widget. If this is omitted, a key will be generated for the widget based on its content. Multiple widgets of the same type may not share the same key.

help (str)

An optional tooltip that gets displayed next to the select slider.

on_change (callable)

An optional callback invoked when this select_slider's value changes.

args (tuple)

An optional tuple of args to pass to the callback.

kwargs (dict)

An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback.

disabled (bool)

An optional boolean, which disables the select slider if set to True. The default is False.

label_visibility ("visible", "hidden", or "collapsed")

The visibility of the label. If "hidden", the label doesn't show but there is still empty space for it above the widget (equivalent to label=""). If "collapsed", both the label and the space are removed. Default is "visible".

Returns

(any value or tuple of any value)

The current value of the slider widget. The return type will match the data type of the value parameter.

Examples
import streamlit as st

color = st.select_slider(
    'Select a color of the rainbow',
    options=['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'indigo', 'violet'])
st.write('My favorite color is', color)
Copy

And here's an example of a range select slider:

import streamlit as st

start_color, end_color = st.select_slider(
    'Select a range of color wavelength',
    options=['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'indigo', 'violet'],
    value=('red', 'blue'))
st.write('You selected wavelengths between', start_color, 'and', end_color)
Copy

Configure a text column in st.dataframe or st.data_editor.

This is the default column type for string values. This command needs to be used in the column_config parameter of st.dataframe or st.data_editor. When used with st.data_editor, editing will be enabled with a text input widget.

Function signature
[source]

st.column_config.TextColumn(label=None, *, width=None, help=None, disabled=None, required=None, default=None, max_chars=None, validate=None)

Parameters

label (str or None)

The label shown at the top of the column. If None (default), the column name is used.

width ("small", "medium", "large", or None)

The display width of the column. Can be one of "small", "medium", or "large". If None (default), the column will be sized to fit the cell contents.

help (str or None)

An optional tooltip that gets displayed when hovering over the column label.

disabled (bool or None)

Whether editing should be disabled for this column. Defaults to False.

required (bool or None)

Whether edited cells in the column need to have a value. If True, an edited cell can only be submitted if it has a value other than None. Defaults to False.

default (str or None)

Specifies the default value in this column when a new row is added by the user.

max_chars (int or None)

The maximum number of characters that can be entered. If None (default), there will be no maximum.

validate (str or None)

A regular expression (JS flavor, e.g. "^[a-z]+$") that edited values are validated against. If the input is invalid, it will not be submitted.

Examples
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

data_df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "widgets": ["st.selectbox", "st.number_input", "st.text_area", "st.button"],
    }
)

st.data_editor(

Display a widget that returns pictures from the user's webcam.

Function signature
[source]

st.camera_input(label, key=None, help=None, on_change=None, args=None, kwargs=None, *, disabled=False, label_visibility="visible")

Parameters

label (str)

A short label explaining to the user what this widget is used for. The label can optionally contain Markdown and supports the following elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, Emojis, and Links.

This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1: and :sunglasses:. For a list of all supported codes, see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Display unsupported elements as literal characters by backslash-escaping them. E.g. 1\. Not an ordered list.

For accessibility reasons, you should never set an empty label (label="") but hide it with label_visibility if needed. In the future, we may disallow empty labels by raising an exception.

key (str or int)

An optional string or integer to use as the unique key for the widget. If this is omitted, a key will be generated for the widget based on its content. Multiple widgets of the same type may not share the same key.

help (str)

A tooltip that gets displayed next to the camera input.

on_change (callable)

An optional callback invoked when this camera_input's value changes.

args (tuple)

An optional tuple of args to pass to the callback.

kwargs (dict)

An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback.

disabled (bool)

An optional boolean, which disables the camera input if set to True. Default is False.

label_visibility ("visible", "hidden", or "collapsed")

The visibility of the label. If "hidden", the label doesn't show but there is still empty space for it above the widget (equivalent to label=""). If "collapsed", both the label and the space are removed. Default is "visible".

Returns

(None or UploadedFile)

The UploadedFile class is a subclass of BytesIO, and therefore it is "file-like". This means you can pass them anywhere where a file is expected.

Examples
import streamlit as st

picture = st.camera_input("Take a picture")

if picture:
    st.image(picture)
Copy

To read the image file buffer as bytes, you can use getvalue() on the UploadedFile object.

import streamlit as st

img_file_buffer = st.camera_input("Take a picture")

if img_file_buffer is not None:
    # To read image file buffer as bytes:
    bytes_data = img_file_buffer.getvalue()
    # Check the type of bytes_data:
    # Should output: <class 'bytes'>
    st.write(type(bytes_data))

priority_high
Important

st.camera_input returns an object of the UploadedFile class, which a subclass of BytesIO. Therefore it is a "file-like" object. This means you can pass it anywhere where a file is expected, similar to st.file_uploader.

Image processing examples

You can use the output of st.camera_input for various downstream tasks, including image processing. Below, we demonstrate how to use the st.camera_input widget with popular image and data processing libraries such as Pillow, NumPy, OpenCV, TensorFlow, torchvision, and PyTorch.

While we provide examples for the most popular use-cases and libraries, you are welcome to adapt these examples to your own needs and favorite libraries.

Pillow (PIL) and NumPy

Ensure you have installed Pillow and NumPy.

To read the image file buffer as a PIL Image and convert it to a NumPy array:

import streamlit as st
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

img_file_buffer = st.camera_input("Take a picture")

if img_file_buffer is not None:
    # To read image file buffer as a PIL Image:
    img = Image.open(img_file_buffer)

    # To convert PIL Image to numpy array:
    img_array = np.array(img)

    # Check the type of img_array:
    # Should output: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
    st.write(type(img_array))

    # Check the shape of img_array:
    # Should output shape: (height, width, channels)
    st.write(img_array.shape)

OpenCV (cv2)

Ensure you have installed OpenCV and NumPy.

To read the image file buffer with OpenCV:

import streamlit as st
import cv2
import numpy as np

img_file_buffer = st.camera_input("Take a picture")

if img_file_buffer is not None:
    # To read image file buffer with OpenCV:
    bytes_data = img_file_buffer.getvalue()
    cv2_img = cv2.imdecode(np.frombuffer(bytes_data, np.uint8), cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)

    # Check the type of cv2_img:
    # Should output: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
    st.write(type(cv2_img))

    # Check the shape of cv2_img:
    # Should output shape: (height, width, channels)
    st.write(cv2_img.shape)

TensorFlow

Ensure you have installed TensorFlow.

To read the image file buffer as a 3 dimensional uint8 tensor with TensorFlow:

import streamlit as st
import tensorflow as tf

img_file_buffer = st.camera_input("Take a picture")

if img_file_buffer is not None:
    # To read image file buffer as a 3D uint8 tensor with TensorFlow:
    bytes_data = img_file_buffer.getvalue()
    img_tensor = tf.io.decode_image(bytes_data, channels=3)

    # Check the type of img_tensor:
    # Should output: <class 'tensorflow.python.framework.ops.EagerTensor'>
    st.write(type(img_tensor))

    # Check the shape of img_tensor:
    # Should output shape: (height, width, channels)
    st.write(img_tensor.shape)

Torchvision

Ensure you have installed Torchvision (it is not bundled with PyTorch) and PyTorch.

To read the image file buffer as a 3 dimensional uint8 tensor with torchvision.io:

import streamlit as st
import torch
import torchvision

img_file_buffer = st.camera_input("Take a picture")

if img_file_buffer is not None:
    # To read image file buffer as a 3D uint8 tensor with `torchvision.io`:
    bytes_data = img_file_buffer.getvalue()
    torch_img = torchvision.io.decode_image(
        torch.frombuffer(bytes_data, dtype=torch.uint8)
    )

    # Check the type of torch_img:
    # Should output: <class 'torch.Tensor'>
    st.write(type(torch_img))

    # Check the shape of torch_img:
    # Should output shape: torch.Size([channels, height, width])
    st.write(torch_img.shape)

PyTorch

Ensure you have installed PyTorch and NumPy.

To read the image file buffer as a 3 dimensional uint8 tensor with PyTorch:

import streamlit as st
import torch
import numpy as np

img_file_buffer = st.camera_input("Take a picture")

if img_file_buffer is not None:
    # To read image file buffer as a 3D uint8 tensor with PyTorch:
    bytes_data = img_file_buffer.getvalue()
    torch_img = torch.ops.image.decode_image(
        torch.from_numpy(np.frombuffer(bytes_data, np.uint8)), 3
    )

    # Check the type of torch_img:
    # Should output: <class 'torch.Tensor'>
    st.write(type(torch_img))

    # Check the shape of torch_img:
    # Should output shape: torch.Size([channels, height, width])
    st.write(torch_img.shape)

Configure a selectbox column in st.dataframe or st.data_editor.

This is the default column type for Pandas categorical values. This command needs to be used in the column_config parameter of st.dataframe or st.data_editor. When used with st.data_editor, editing will be enabled with a selectbox widget.

Function signature
[source]

st.column_config.SelectboxColumn(label=None, *, width=None, help=None, disabled=None, required=None, default=None, options=None)

Parameters

label (str or None)

The label shown at the top of the column. If None (default), the column name is used.

width ("small", "medium", "large", or None)

The display width of the column. Can be one of "small", "medium", or "large". If None (default), the column will be sized to fit the cell contents.

help (str or None)

An optional tooltip that gets displayed when hovering over the column label.

disabled (bool or None)

Whether editing should be disabled for this column. Defaults to False.

required (bool or None)

Whether edited cells in the column need to have a value. If True, an edited cell can only be submitted if it has a value other than None. Defaults to False.

default (str, int, float, bool, or None)

Specifies the default value in this column when a new row is added by the user.

options (Iterable of str or None)

The options that can be selected during editing. If None (default), this will be inferred from the underlying dataframe column if its dtype is "category" (see Pandas docs on categorical data).

Examples
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

data_df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "category": [
            "üìä Data Exploration",
            "üìà Data Visualization",
            "ü§ñ LLM",
            "üìä Data Exploration",
        ],
    }
)

st.data_editor(
    data_df,
    column_config={
        "category": st.column_config.SelectboxColumn(
            "App Category",
            help="The category of the app",
            width="medium",
            options=[
                "üìä Data Exploration",
                "üìà Data Visualization",
                "ü§ñ LLM",

default (int, float, or None)

Specifies the default value in this column when a new row is added by the user.

format (str or None)

A printf-style format string controlling how numbers are displayed. This does not impact the return value. Valid formatters: %d %e %f %g %i %u. You can also add prefixes and suffixes, e.g. "$ %.2f" to show a dollar prefix.

min_value (int, float, or None)

The minimum value that can be entered. If None (default), there will be no minimum.

max_value (int, float, or None)

The maximum value that can be entered. If None (default), there will be no maximum.

step (int, float, or None)

The stepping interval. Specifies the precision of numbers that can be entered. If None (default), uses 1 for integers and unrestricted precision for floats.

import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

data_df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "price": [20, 950, 250, 500],
    }
)

st.data_editor(
    data_df,
    column_config={
        "price": st.column_config.NumberColumn(
            "Price (in USD)",
            help="The price of the product in USD",
            min_value=0,
            max_value=1000,
            step=1,

Function signature
[source]

st.column_config.Column(label=None, *, width=None, help=None, disabled=None, required=None)

Parameters

label (str or None)

The label shown at the top of the column. If None (default), the column name is used.

width ("small", "medium", "large", or None)

The display width of the column. Can be one of "small", "medium", or "large". If None (default), the column will be sized to fit the cell contents.

help (str or None)

An optional tooltip that gets displayed when hovering over the column label.

disabled (bool or None)

Whether editing should be disabled for this column. Defaults to False.

required (bool or None)

Whether edited cells in the column need to have a value. If True, an edited cell can only be submitted if it has a value other than None. Defaults to False.

Examples
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

data_df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "widgets": ["st.selectbox", "st.number_input", "st.text_area", "st.button"],
    }
)

st.data_editor(
    data_df,
    column_config={

Deprecation notice

st.experimental_get_query_params was deprecated in version 1.30.0. Use st.query_params instead.

Return the query parameters that is currently showing in the browser's URL bar.

Function signature
[source]

st.experimental_get_query_params()

Returns

(dict)

The current query parameters as a dict. "Query parameters" are the part of the URL that comes after the first "?".

Example

Let's say the user's web browser is at http://localhost:8501/?show_map=True&selected=asia&selected=america. Then, you can get the query parameters using the following:

import streamlit as st

st.experimental_get_query_params()
{"show_map": ["True"], "selected": ["asia", "america"]}
Copy

Note that the values in the returned dict are always lists. This is because we internally use Python's urllib.parse.parse_qs(), which behaves this way. And this behavior makes sense when you consider that every item in a query string is potentially a 1-element array.

View-only access to app after changing GitHub username or repository name

This KB helps to resolve the issue of the apps becoming view-only.

Problem

When opening the dropdown menu of the apps on Streamlit Community CLoud, the options Reboot, Delete and Settings is grayed out, and there is a message "You have view-only access to this application".

Changing your GitHub username or the repository name after deploying an app causes your app to become view-only.

Solution

Please reach out to the Snowflake support team to delete the affected app(s) for you so you can redeploy them with your new username.

Upgrade the Streamlit version of your app on Streamlit Community Cloud

Want to use a cool new Streamlit feature but your app on Streamlit Community Cloud is running an old version of the Streamlit library? If that's you, don't worry! All you need to do is upgrade your app's Streamlit version. Here are five ways to do this, based on how your app manages dependencies:

No dependency file

When there is no dependency file in the repo, the app will always use the same Streamlit version that existed when the app was first deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud; even if you reboot the app! In other words, Streamlit Community Cloud automatically pins the version for you so that the app does not break suddenly when rebooted in the future.

You may want to avoid getting into this situation if your app depends on a specific version of Streamlit. That is why we encourage you to use a dependency file and pin your desired version of Streamlit. We cover this in more detail in the sections below.

requirements.txt
If the Streamlit version is not pinned (i.e., the requirements file contains a line with streamlit and nothing else):
Reboot the app as described above.
If the Streamlit version is pinned (e.g., streamlit==1.4.0):
Adapt the pinned version in the requirements file and push it to GitHub.
The app on Streamlit Community Cloud will reboot automatically as soon as it detects these changes.
pipenv/poetry/conda

If you use any of these dependency managers, you probably know what you need to do. üòâ

On your local computer, run the command to update the Streamlit package:
pipenv update streamlit or
poetry update streamlit or
With an activated conda environment, run:
pip install -U streamlit and
conda env export
Then push any changes to Pipfile.lock or poetry.lock or environment.yml to GitHub.
The app on Streamlit Community Cloud will reboot automatically as soon as it detects these changes.

How do I increase the upload limit of st.file_uploader on Streamlit Community Cloud?
Overview

By default, files uploaded using st.file_uploader() are limited to 200MB. You can configure this using the server.maxUploadSize config option.

Streamlit provides four different ways to set configuration options:

In a global config file at ~/.streamlit/config.toml for macOS/Linux or %userprofile%/.streamlit/config.toml for Windows:
[server]
maxUploadSize = 200

In a per-project config file at $CWD/.streamlit/config.toml, where $CWD is the folder you're running Streamlit from.
Through STREAMLIT_* environment variables, such as:
export STREAMLIT_SERVER_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE=200

As flags on the command line when running streamlit run:
streamlit run your_script.py --server.maxUploadSize 200


Which of the four options should you choose for an app deployed to Streamlit Community Cloud? ü§î

Solution

When deploying your app to Streamlit Community Cloud, you should use option 1. Namely, set the maxUploadSize config option in a global config file (.streamlit/config.toml) uploaded to your app's GitHub repo. üéà

For example, to increase the upload limit to 400MB, upload a .streamlit/config.toml file containing the following lines to your app's GitHub repo:

[server]
maxUploadSize = 400

Organizing your apps with workspaces on Streamlit Community Cloud

Streamlit Community Cloud is organized into workspaces, which automatically group your apps according to the corresponding GitHub repository's owner. If you are part of multiple repositories, then you will have multiple workspaces.

Personal workspace

If an app's GitHub repository is owned by you, the app will appear in your personal workspace, named "<YourGitHubHandle>".

Organization workspace

If an app's GitHub repository is owned by an organization (such as your company), the app will appear in a separate workspace, named "<GitHubOrganizationHandle>".

Workspaces with view access

You will also have access to any workspaces containing app(s) for which you only have view access. These apps will have a "view-only" tooltip when you click on their respective overflow menu icons (‚ãÆ).

Switching between workspaces

To switch between workspaces, click on the workspace listed in the top right corner, then select the desired workspace name.

Authentication without SSO
Introduction

Want to secure your Streamlit app with passwords, but cannot implement single sign-on? We got you covered! This guide shows you two simple techniques for adding basic authentication to your Streamlit app, using Secrets management.

priority_high
Warning

While this technique adds some level of security, it is NOT comparable to proper authentication with an SSO provider.

Option 1: One global password for all users

This is the easiest option! Your app will ask for a password that's shared between all users. It will be stored in the app secrets using Secrets management. If you want to change this password or revoke a user's access, you will need to change it for everyone. If you want to have one password per user instead, jump to Option 2 below.

Step 1: Add the password to your local app secrets

Your local Streamlit app will read secrets from a file .streamlit/secrets.toml in your app's root dir. Create this file if it doesn't exist yet and add your password to it as shown below:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml

password = "streamlit123"

priority_high
Important

Be sure to add this file to your .gitignore so you don't commit your secrets!

Step 2: Copy your app secrets to the cloud

As the secrets.toml file above is not committed to GitHub, you need to pass its content to your deployed app (on Streamlit Community Cloud) separately. Go to the app dashboard and in the app's dropdown menu, click on Edit Secrets. Copy the content of secrets.toml into the text area. More information is available at Secrets management.

Step 3: Ask for the password in your Streamlit app

Copy the code below to your Streamlit app, insert your normal app code below the check_password() function call at the bottom, and run it:

# streamlit_app.py

import hmac
import streamlit as st


def check_password():
    """Returns `True` if the user had the correct password."""

    def password_entered():
        """Checks whether a password entered by the user is correct."""
        if hmac.compare_digest(st.session_state["password"], st.secrets["password"]):
            st.session_state["password_correct"] = True
            del st.session_state["password"]  # Don't store the password.
        else:
            st.session_state["password_correct"] = False

    # Return True if the password is validated.
    if st.session_state.get("password_correct", False):
        return True

    # Show input for password.
    st.text_input(
        "Password", type="password", on_change=password_entered, key="password"
    )
    if "password_correct" in st.session_state:
        st.error("üòï Password incorrect")
    return False


if not check_password():
    st.stop()  # Do not continue if check_password is not True.

# Main Streamlit app starts here
st.write("Here goes your normal Streamlit app...")
st.button("Click me")


If everything worked out, your app should look like this:

Option 2: Individual password for each user

This option allows you to set a username and password for each user of your app. Like in Option 1, both values will be stored in the app secrets using Secrets management.

Step 1: Add usernames & passwords to your local app secrets

Your local Streamlit app will read secrets from a file .streamlit/secrets.toml in your app's root dir. Create this file if it doesn't exist yet and add the usernames & password to it as shown below:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml

[passwords]
# Follow the rule: username = "password"
alice_foo = "streamlit123"
bob_bar = "mycrazypw"

priority_high
Important

Be sure to add this file to your .gitignore so you don't commit your secrets!

Alternatively, you could set up and manage usernames & passwords via a spreadsheet or database. To use secrets to securely connect to Google Sheets, AWS, and other data providers, read our tutorials on how to Connect Streamlit to data sources.

Step 2: Copy your app secrets to the cloud

As the secrets.toml file above is not committed to GitHub, you need to pass its content to your deployed app (on Streamlit Community Cloud) separately. Go to the app dashboard and in the app's dropdown menu, click on Edit Secrets. Copy the content of secrets.toml into the text area. More information is available at Secrets management.

Step 3: Ask for username & password in your Streamlit app

Copy the code below to your Streamlit app, insert your normal app code below the check_password() function call at the bottom, and run it:

# streamlit_app.py

import hmac
import streamlit as st


def check_password():
    """Returns `True` if the user had a correct password."""

    def login_form():
        """Form with widgets to collect user information"""
        with st.form("Credentials"):
            st.text_input("Username", key="username")
            st.text_input("Password", type="password", key="password")
            st.form_submit_button("Log in", on_click=password_entered)

    def password_entered():
        """Checks whether a password entered by the user is correct."""
        if st.session_state["username"] in st.secrets[
            "passwords"
        ] and hmac.compare_digest(
            st.session_state["password"],
            st.secrets.passwords[st.session_state["username"]],
        ):
            st.session_state["password_correct"] = True
            del st.session_state["password"]  # Don't store the username or password.
            del st.session_state["username"]
        else:
            st.session_state["password_correct"] = False

    # Return True if the username + password is validated.
    if st.session_state.get("password_correct", False):
        return True

    # Show inputs for username + password.
    login_form()
    if "password_correct" in st.session_state:
        st.error("üòï User not known or password incorrect")
    return False


if not check_password():
    st.stop()

# Main Streamlit app starts here
st.write("Here goes your normal Streamlit app...")
st.button("Click me")


If everything worked out, your app should look like this:

Argh. This app has gone over its resource limits
Argh. This app has gone over its resource limits

Sorry! It means you've hit the resource limits of your Streamlit Community Cloud account.

There are a few things you can change in your app to make it less resource-hungry:

Reboot your app (temporary fix)
Use st.cache_data or st.cache_resource to load models or data only once
Restrict the cache size with ttl or max_entries
Move big datasets to a database
Profile your app's memory usage

Check out our blog post on "Common app problems: Resource limits" for more in-depth tips prevent your app from hitting the resource limits of the Streamlit Community Cloud.

App is not loading when running remotely
CONTENTS
Symptom #1: The app never loads
Symptom #2: The app says "Please wait..." forever
Symptom #3: Unable to upload files when running in multiple replicas
App is not loading when running remotely

Below are a few common errors that occur when users spin up their own solution to host a Streamlit app remotely.

To learn about a deceptively simple way to host Streamlit apps that avoids all the issues below, check out Streamlit Community Cloud.

Symptom #1: The app never loads

When you enter the app's URL in a browser and all you see is a blank page, a "Page not found" error, a "Connection refused" error, or anything like that, first check that Streamlit is actually running on the remote server. On a Linux server you can SSH into it and then run:

ps -Al | grep streamlit


If you see Streamlit running, the most likely culprit is the Streamlit port not being exposed. The fix depends on your exact setup. Below are three example fixes:

Try port 80: Some hosts expose port 80 by default. To set Streamlit to use that port, start Streamlit with the --server.port option:

streamlit run my_app.py --server.port=80


AWS EC2 server: First, click on your instance in the AWS Console. Then scroll down and click on Security Groups ‚Üí Inbound ‚Üí Edit. Next, add a Custom TCP rule that allows the Port Range 8501 with Source 0.0.0.0/0.

Other types of server: Check the firewall settings.

If that still doesn't solve the problem, try running a simple HTTP server instead of Streamlit, and seeing if that works correctly. If it does, then you know the problem lies somewhere in your Streamlit app or configuration (in which case you should ask for help in our forums!) If not, then it's definitely unrelated to Streamlit.

How to start a simple HTTP server:

python -m http.server [port]

Symptom #2: The app says "Please wait..." forever

If when you try to load your app in a browser you see a blue box in the center of the page with the text "Please wait...", the underlying cause is likely one of the following:

Misconfigured CORS protection.
Server is stripping headers from the Websocket connection, thereby breaking compression.

To diagnose the issue, try temporarily disabling CORS protection by running Streamlit with the --server.enableCORS flag set to false:

streamlit run my_app.py --server.enableCORS=false


If this fixes your issue, you should re-enable CORS protection and then set browser.serverPort and browser.serverAddress to the URL and port of your Streamlit app.

If the issue persists, try disabling websocket compression by running Streamlit with the --server.enableWebsocketCompression flag set to false

streamlit run my_app.py --server.enableWebsocketCompression=false


If this fixes your issue, your server setup is likely stripping the Sec-WebSocket-Extensions HTTP header that is used to negotiate Websocket compression.

Compression is not required for Streamlit to work, but it's strongly recommended as it improves performance. If you'd like to turn it back on, you'll need to find which part of your infrastructure is stripping the Sec-WebSocket-Extensions HTTP header and change that behavior.

Symptom #3: Unable to upload files when running in multiple replicas

If the file uploader widget returns an error with status code 403, this is probably due to a misconfiguration in your app's XSRF protection logic.

To diagnose the issue, try temporarily disabling XSRF protection by running Streamlit with the --server.enableXsrfProtection flag set to false:

streamlit run my_app.py --server.enableXsrfProtection=false


If this fixes your issue, you should re-enable XSRF protection and then configure your app to use the same secret across every replica by setting the server.cookieSecret config option to the same hard-to-guess string everywhere.

Does Streamlit support the WSGI Protocol? (aka Can I deploy Streamlit with gunicorn?)
Problem

You're not sure whether your Streamlit app can be deployed with gunicorn.

Solution

Streamlit does not support the WSGI protocol at this time, so deploying Streamlit with (for example) gunicorn is not currently possible. Check out this forum thread regarding deploying Streamlit in a gunicorn-like manner to see how other users have accomplished this.

Invoking a Python subprocess in a deployed Streamlit app
Problem

Let's suppose you want to invoke a subprocess to run a Python script script.py in your deployed Streamlit app streamlit_app.py. For example, the machine learning library Ludwig is run using a command-line interface, or maybe you want to run a bash script or similar type of process from Python.

You have tried the following, but run into dependency issues for script.py, even though you have specified your Python dependencies in a requirements file:

# streamlit_app.py
import streamlit as st
import subprocess

subprocess.run(["python", "script.py"])

Solution

When you run the above code block, you will get the version of Python that is on the system path‚Äînot necessarily the Python executable installed in the virtual environment that the Streamlit code is running under.

The solution is to detect the Python executable directly with sys.executable:

# streamlit_app.py
import streamlit as st
import subprocess
import sys

subprocess.run([f"{sys.executable}", "script.py"])


This ensures that script.py is running under the same Python executable as your Streamlit code‚Äîwhere your Python dependencies are installed.

How can I deploy multiple Streamlit apps on different subdomains?
Problem

You want to deploy multiple Streamlit apps on different subdomains.

Solution

Like running your Streamlit app on more common ports such as 80, subdomains are handled by a web server like Apache or Nginx:

Set up a web server on a machine with a public IP address, then use a DNS server to point all desired subdomains to your webserver's IP address

Configure your web server to route requests for each subdomain to the different ports that your Streamlit apps are running on

For example, let‚Äôs say you had two Streamlit apps called Calvin and Hobbes. App Calvin is running on port 8501. You set up app Hobbes to run on port 8502. Your webserver would then be set up to "listen" for requests on subdomains calvin.somedomain.com and hobbes.subdomain.com, and route requests to port 8501 and 8502, respectively.

Check out these two tutorials for Apache2 and Nginx that deal with setting up a webserver to redirect subdomains to different ports:

How do I deploy Streamlit on a domain so it appears to run on a regular port (i.e. port 80)?
Problem

You want to deploy a Streamlit app on a domain so it appears to run on port 80.

Solution

You should use a reverse proxy to forward requests from a webserver like Apache or Nginx to the port where your Streamlit app is running. You can accomplish this in several different ways. The simplest way is to forward all requests sent to your domain so that your Streamlit app appears as the content of your website.

Another approach is to configure¬†your webserver to forward requests to designated subfolders (e.g. http://awesomestuff.net/streamlitapp) to different Streamlit apps on the same domain, as in this example config for Nginx submitted by a Streamlit community member.

How to install a package not on PyPI/Conda but available on GitHub
Overview

Are you trying to deploy your app to Streamlit Community Cloud, but don't know how to specify a Python dependency in your requirements file that is available on a public GitHub repo but not any package index like PyPI or Conda? If so, continue reading to find out how!

Let's suppose you want to install SomePackage and its Python dependencies from GitHub, a hosting service for the popular version control system (VCS) Git. And suppose SomePackage is found at the the following URL: https://github.com/SomePackage.git.

pip (via requirements.txt) supports installing from GitHub. This support requires a working executable to be available (for Git). It is used through a URL prefix: git+.

Specify the GitHub web URL

To install SomePackage, innclude the following in your requirements.txt file:

git+https://github.com/SomePackage#egg=SomePackage


You can even specify a "git ref" such as branch name, a commit hash or a tag name, as shown in the examples below.

Specify a Git branch name

Install SomePackage by specifying a branch name such as main, master, develop, etc, in requirements.txt:

git+https://github.com/SomePackage.git@main#egg=SomePackage

Specify a commit hash

Install SomePackage by specifying a commit hash in requirements.txt:

git+https://github.com/SomePackage.git@eb40b4ff6f7c5c1e4366cgfg0671291bge918#egg=SomePackage

Specify a tag

Install SomePackage by specifying a tag in requirements.txt:

git+https://github.com/SomePackage.git@v1.1.0#egg=SomePackage

Limitations

It is currently not possible to install private packages from private GitHub repos using the URI form:

git+https://{token}@github.com/user/project.git@{version}


where version is a tag, a branch, or a commit. And token is a personal access token with read only permissions. Streamlit Community Cloud only supports installing public packages from public GitHub repos.

Solution
ERROR: No matching distribution found for
Problem

You receive the error ERROR: No matching distribution found for when you deploy an app on Streamlit Community Cloud.

Solution

This error occurs when you deploy an app on Streamlit Community Cloud and have one or more of the following issues with your Python dependencies in your requirements file:

The package is part of the Python Standard Library. E.g. You will see ERROR: No matching distribution found for base64 if you include base64 in your requirements file, as it is part of the Python Standard Library. The solution is to not include the package in your requirements file. Only include packages in your requirements file that are not distributed with a standard Python installation.
The package name in your requirements file is misspelled. Double-check the package name before including it in your requirements file.
The package does not support the operating system on which your Streamlit app is running. E.g. You see ERROR: No matching distribution found for pywin32 while deploying to Streamlit Community Cloud. The pywin32 module provides access to many of the Windows APIs from Python. Apps deployed to Streamlit Community Cloud are executed in a Linux environment. As such, pywin32 fails to install on non-Windows systems, including on Streamlit Community Cloud. The solution is to either exclude pywin32 from your requirements file, or deploy your app on a cloud service offering Windows machines.

Problem

You receive the error ModuleNotFoundError: No module named when you deploy an app on Streamlit Community Cloud.

Solution

This error occurs when you import a module on Streamlit Community Cloud that isn‚Äôt included in your requirements file. Any external Python dependencies that are not distributed with a standard Python installation should be included in your requirements file.

E.g. You will see ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sklearn' if you don‚Äôt include scikit-learn in your requirements file and import sklearn in your app.

ImportError libGL.so.1 cannot open shared object file No such file or directory
Problem

You receive the error ImportError libGL.so.1 cannot open shared object file No such file or directory when using OpenCV in your app deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud.

Solution

If you use OpenCV in your app, include opencv-python-headless in your requirements file on Streamlit Community Cloud in place of opencv_contrib_python and opencv-python.

If opencv-python is a required (non-optional) dependency of your app or a dependency of a library used in your app, the above solution is not applicable. Instead, you can use the following solution:

Create a packages.txt file in your repo with the following line to install the apt-get dependency libgl:

libgl1

What types of things aren't possible with Streamlit Components?

Because each Streamlit Component gets mounted into its own sandboxed iframe, this implies a few limitations on what is possible with Components:

Can't communicate with other Components: Components can‚Äôt contain (or otherwise communicate with) other components, so Components cannot be used to build something like grid_layout
Can't modify CSS: A Component can‚Äôt modify the CSS that the rest of the Streamlit app uses, so you can't create something like dark_mode
Can't add/remove elements: A Component can‚Äôt add or remove other elements of a Streamlit app, so you couldn't make something like remove_streamlit_app_menu

How do Streamlit Components differ from functionality provided in the base Streamlit package?

Streamlit Components are wrapped up in an iframe, which gives you the ability to do whatever you want (within the iframe) using any web technology you like.

There is a strict message protocol between Components and Streamlit, which makes possible for Components to act as widgets. As Streamlit Components are wrapped in iframe, they cannot modify their parent‚Äôs DOM (a.k.a the Streamlit report), which ensures that Streamlit is always secure even with user-written components.

What is serializable session state?
What is serializable session state?
Serializable Session State

Serialization refers to the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be persisted and shared, and allowing you to recover the data‚Äôs original structure. Python‚Äôs built-in pickle module serializes Python objects to a byte stream ("pickling") and deserializes the stream into an object ("unpickling").

By default, Streamlit‚Äôs Session State allows you to persist any Python object for the duration of the session, irrespective of the object‚Äôs pickle-serializability. This property lets you store Python primitives such as integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers and booleans, dataframes, and even lambdas returned by functions. However, some execution environments may require serializing all data in Session State, so it may be useful to detect incompatibility during development, or when the execution environment will stop supporting it in the future.

To that end, Streamlit provides a runner.enforceSerializableSessionState configuration option that, when set to true, only allows pickle-serializable objects in Session State. To enable the option, either create a global or project config file with the following or use it as a command-line flag:

# .streamlit/config.toml
[runner]
enforceSerializableSessionState = true


By "pickle-serializable", we mean calling pickle.dumps(obj) should not raise a PicklingError exception. When the config option is enabled, adding unserializable data to session state should result in an exception. E.g.,

import streamlit as st

def unserializable_data():
		return lambda x: x

#üëá results in an exception when enforceSerializableSessionState is on
st.session_state.unserializable = unserializable_data()

Why does Streamlit restrict nested st.columns?
Why does Streamlit restrict nested
st.columns
?

Starting in version 1.18.0, Streamlit allows nesting st.columns inside other st.columns with the following restrictions:

In the main area of the app, columns can be nested up to one level of nesting.
In the sidebar, columns cannot be nested.

These restrictions are in place to make Streamlit apps look good on all device sizes. Nesting columns multiple times often leads to a bad UI. You might be able to make it look good on one screen size but as soon as a user on a different screen views the app, they will have a bad experience. Some columns will be tiny, others will be way too long, and complex layouts will look out of place. Streamlit tries its best to automatically resize elements to look good across devices, without any help from the developer. But for complex layouts with multiple levels of nesting, this is not possible.

We are always working on improving layout options though! So if you have a use case that requires a more complex layout, please open a GitHub issue, ideally with a sketch of what you want to do.

How do I create an anchor link?
Overview

Have you wanted to create anchors so that users of your app can directly navigate to specific sections by specifying #anchor in the URL? If so, let's find out how.

Solution

Anchors are automatically added to header text.

For example, if you define a header text via the st.header() command as follows:

st.header("Section 1")


Then you can create a link to this header using:

st.markdown("[Section 1](#section-1)")

Examples

You are using session state to store page interactions in your app. When users interact with a widget in your app (e.g., click a button), you expect your app to update its widget states and reflect the new values. However, you notice that it doesn't. Instead, users have to interact with the widget twice (e.g., click a button twice) for the app to show the correct values. What do you do now? ü§î Let's walk through the solution in the section below.

Solution

When using session state to update widgets or values in your script, you need to use the unique key you assigned to the widget, not the variable that you assigned your widget to. In the example code block below, the unique key assigned to the slider widget is slider, and the variable the widget is assigned to is slide_val.

Let's see this in an example. Say you want a user to click a button that resets a slider.

To have the slider's value update on the button click, you need to use a callback function with the on_click parameter of st.button:

# the callback function for the button will add 1 to the
# slider value up to 10
def plus_one():
    if st.session_state["slider"] < 10:
        st.session_state.slider += 1
    else:
        pass
    return

# when creating the button, assign the name of your callback
# function to the on_click parameter
add_one = st.button("Add one to the slider", on_click=plus_one, key="add_one")

# create the slider
slide_val = st.slider("Pick a number", 0, 10, key="slider")

How do I upgrade to the latest version of Streamlit?

We recommend upgrading to the latest official release of Streamlit so you have access to the newest, cutting-edge features. If you haven't installed Streamlit yet, please read our Installation guide. It helps you set up your virtual environment and walks you through installing Streamlit on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Regardless of which package management tool and OS you're using, we recommend running the commands on this page in a virtual environment.

If you've previously installed Streamlit and want to upgrade to the latest version, here's how to do it based on your dependency manager.

Pipenv

Streamlit's officially-supported environment manager for macOS and Linux is Pipenv.

Navigate to the project folder containing your Pipenv environment:
cd myproject

Activate that environment, upgrade Streamlit, and verify you have the latest version:
pipenv shell
pip install --upgrade streamlit
streamlit version


Or if you want to use an easily-reproducible environment, replace pip with pipenvevery time you install or update a package:

pipenv update streamlit
pipenv run streamlit version

Conda
Activate the conda environment where Streamlit is installed:
conda activate $ENVIRONMENT_NAME


Be sure to replace$ENVIRONMENT_NAME ‚òùÔ∏è with the name your conda environment!

Update Streamlit within the active conda environment and verify you have the latest version:
conda update -c conda-forge streamlit -y
streamlit version

Poetry

In order to get the latest version of Streamlit with Poetry and verify you have the latest version, run:

poetry update streamlit
streamlit version

Build an LLM app using LangChain
Build an LLM app using LangChain
OpenAI, LangChain, and Streamlit in 18 lines of code

In this tutorial, you will build a Streamlit LLM app that can generate text from a user-provided prompt. This Python app will use the LangChain framework and Streamlit. Optionally, you can deploy your app to Streamlit Community Cloud when you're done.

This tutorial is adapted from a blog post by Chanin Nantesanamat: LangChain tutorial #1: Build an LLM-powered app in 18 lines of code.

Objectives
Get an OpenAI key from the end user.
Validate the user's OpenAI key.
Get a text prompt from the user.
Authenticate OpenAI with the user's key.
Send the user's prompt to OpenAI's API.
Get a response and display it.

Bonus: Deploy the app on Streamlit Community Cloud!

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Streamlit
LangChain
OpenAI API key
Setup coding environment

In your IDE (integrated coding environment), open the terminal and install the following three Python libraries:

pip install streamlit openai langchain


Create a requirements.txt file located in the root of your working directory and save these dependencies. This is necessary for deploying the app to the Streamlit Community Cloud later.

streamlit
openai
langchain

Building the app

The app is only 18 lines of code:

import streamlit as st
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

st.title('ü¶úüîó Quickstart App')

openai_api_key = st.sidebar.text_input('OpenAI API Key', type='password')

def generate_response(input_text):
    llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7, openai_api_key=openai_api_key)
    st.info(llm(input_text))

with st.form('my_form'):
    text = st.text_area('Enter text:', 'What are the three key pieces of advice for learning how to code?')
    submitted = st.form_submit_button('Submit')
    if not openai_api_key.startswith('sk-'):
        st.warning('Please enter your OpenAI API key!', icon='‚ö†')
    if submitted and openai_api_key.startswith('sk-'):
        generate_response(text)


To start, create a new Python file and save it as¬†streamlit_app.py in the root of your working directory.

Import the necessary Python libraries.

import streamlit as st
from langchain.llms import OpenAI


Create the app's title using st.title.

st.title('ü¶úüîó Quickstart App')


Add a text input box for the user to enter their OpenAI API key.

openai_api_key = st.sidebar.text_input('OpenAI API Key', type='password')


Define a function to authenticate to OpenAI API with the user's key, send a prompt, and get an AI-generated response. This function accepts the user's prompt as an argument and displays the AI-generated response in a blue box using st.info.

def generate_response(input_text):
    llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7, openai_api_key=openai_api_key)
    st.info(llm(input_text))


Finally, use st.form() to create a text box (st.text_area()) for user input. When the user clicks Submit, the generate-response() function is called with the user's input as an argument.

with st.form('my_form'):
    text = st.text_area('Enter text:', 'What are the three key pieces of advice for learning how to code?')
    submitted = st.form_submit_button('Submit')
    if not openai_api_key.startswith('sk-'):
        st.warning('Please enter your OpenAI API key!', icon='‚ö†')
    if submitted and openai_api_key.startswith('sk-'):
        generate_response(text)


Remember to save your file!

Return to your computer's terminal to run the app.

streamlit run streamlit_app.py

Deploying the app

To deploy the app to the Streamlit Cloud, follow these steps:

Create a GitHub repository for the app. Your repository should contain two files:

your-repository/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ streamlit_app.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt


Go to Streamlit Community Cloud, click the¬†New app¬†button from your workspace, then specify the repository, branch, and main file path. Optionally, you can customize your app's URL by choosing a custom subdomain.

Click the¬†Deploy!¬†button.

Your app will now be deployed to Streamlit Community Cloud and can be accessed from around the world! üåé

Conclusion

Congratulations on building an LLM-powered Streamlit app in 18 lines of code! ü•≥ You can use this app to generate text from any prompt that you provide. The app is limited by the capabilities of the OpenAI LLM, but it can still be used to generate some creative and interesting text.

We hope you found this tutorial helpful! Check out more examples to see the power of Streamlit and LLM. üíñ

Happy Streamlit-ing! üéà

Append data to a table or chart

In Streamlit, you can not only replace entire elements in your app, but also modify the data behind those elements. Here is how:

import numpy as np
import time

# Get some data.
data = np.random.randn(10, 2)

# Show the data as a chart.
chart = st.line_chart(data)

# Wait 1 second, so the change is clearer.
time.sleep(1)

# Grab some more data.
data2 = np.random.randn(10, 2)

# Append the new data to the existing chart.
chart.add_rows(data2)

    # Append data to the chart.
    chart.add_rows(new_rows)

    # Pretend we're doing some computation that takes time.

How to insert elements out of order?

You can use the st.empty method as a placeholder, to "save" a slot in your app that you can use later.

st.text('This will appear first')
# Appends some text to the app.

my_slot1 = st.empty()
# Appends an empty slot to the app. We'll use this later.

my_slot2 = st.empty()
# Appends another empty slot.

st.text('This will appear last')
# Appends some more text to the app.

my_slot1.text('This will appear second')
# Replaces the first empty slot with a text string.

my_slot2.line_chart(np.random.randn(20, 2))
# Replaces the second empty slot with a chart.

How can I make st.pydeck_chart use custom Mapbox styles?

If you are supplying a Mapbox token, but the resulting pydeck_chart doesn't show your custom Mapbox styles, please check that you are adding the Mapbox token to the Streamlit config.toml configuration file. Streamlit DOES NOT read Mapbox tokens from inside of a PyDeck specification (i.e. from inside of the Streamlit app). Please see this forum thread for more information.

How do I get dataframe row selections from a user?
How do I get dataframe row-selections from a user?

At the moment, st.dataframe and st.data_editor do not natively support passing user-selected rows to the Python backend. We are working to support this in the future. For now, if you need to get row-selections from a user, you can accomplish this by adding an extra Checkbox column) to your dataframe and using st.data_editor. You can use this extra column to collect a user's selection(s).

Example

In the following example, we define a function which accepts a dataframe and returns the rows selected by a user. Within the function, the dataframe is copied to prevent mutating it. We insert a temporary "Select" column into the copied dataframe before passing the copied data into st.data_editor. We have disabled editing for all other columns, but you can make them editable if desired. After filtering the dataframe and dropping the temporary column, our function returns the selected rows.

import streamlit as st
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "Animal": ["Lion", "Elephant", "Giraffe", "Monkey", "Zebra"],
        "Habitat": ["Savanna", "Forest", "Savanna", "Forest", "Savanna"],
        "Lifespan (years)": [15, 60, 25, 20, 25],
        "Average weight (kg)": [190, 5000, 800, 10, 350],
    }
)

def dataframe_with_selections(df):
    df_with_selections = df.copy()
    df_with_selections.insert(0, "Select", False)

    # Get dataframe row-selections from user with st.data_editor
    edited_df = st.data_editor(
        df_with_selections,
        hide_index=True,
        column_config={"Select": st.column_config.CheckboxColumn(required=True)},
        disabled=df.columns,
    )

    # Filter the dataframe using the temporary column, then drop the column
    selected_rows = edited_df[edited_df.Select]
    return selected_rows.drop('Select', axis=1)


selection = dataframe_with_selections(df)
st.write("Your selection:")
st.write(selection)

How to download a file in Streamlit?
How to download a file in Streamlit?

Use the st.download_button widget that is natively built into Streamlit. Check out a sample app demonstrating how you can use st.download_button to download common file formats.

Example usage
import streamlit as st

# Text files

text_contents = '''
Foo, Bar
123, 456
789, 000
'''

# Different ways to use the API

st.download_button('Download CSV', text_contents, 'text/csv')
st.download_button('Download CSV', text_contents)  # Defaults to 'text/plain'

with open('myfile.csv') as f:
   st.download_button('Download CSV', f)  # Defaults to 'text/plain'

# ---
# Binary files

binary_contents = b'whatever'

# Different ways to use the API

st.download_button('Download file', binary_contents)  # Defaults to 'application/octet-stream'

with open('myfile.zip', 'rb') as f:
   st.download_button('Download Zip', f, file_name='archive.zip')  # Defaults to 'application/octet-stream'

# You can also grab the return value of the button,
# just like with any other button.

if st.download_button(...):
   st.write('Thanks for downloading!')

How do you retrieve the filename of a file uploaded with st.file_uploader?
How do you retrieve the filename of a file uploaded with st.file_uploader?

If you upload a single file (i.e. accept_multiple_files=False), the filename can be retrieved by using the .name attribute on the returned UploadedFile object:

import streamlit as st

uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload a file")

if uploaded_file:
   st.write("Filename: ", uploaded_file.name)


If you upload multiple files (i.e. accept_multiple_files=True), the individual filenames can be retrieved by using the .name attribute on each UploadedFile object in the returned list:

import streamlit as st

uploaded_files = st.file_uploader("Upload multiple files", accept_multiple_files=True)

if uploaded_files:
   for uploaded_file in uploaded_files:
       st.write("Filename: ", uploaded_file.name)

Where does st.file_uploader store uploaded files and when do they get deleted?
Where does st.file_uploader store uploaded files and when do they get deleted?

When you upload a file using st.file_uploader, the data are copied to the Streamlit backend via the browser, and contained in a BytesIO buffer in Python memory (i.e. RAM, not disk). The data will persist in RAM until the Streamlit app re-runs from top-to-bottom, which is on each widget interaction. If you need to save the data that was uploaded between runs, then you can cache it so that Streamlit persists it across re-runs.

As files are stored in memory, they get deleted immediately as soon as they‚Äôre not needed anymore.

This means Streamlit removes a file from memory when:

The user uploads another file, replacing the original one
The user clears the file uploader
The user closes the browser tab where they uploaded the file

If you're having problems running your Streamlit app, here are a few things to try out.

Check #0: Are you using a Streamlit-supported version of Python?

Streamlit will maintain backwards-compatibility with earlier Python versions as practical, guaranteeing compatibility with at least the last three minor versions of Python 3.

As new versions of Python are released, we will try to be compatible with the new version as soon as possible, though frequently we are at the mercy of other Python packages to support these new versions as well.

Streamlit currently supports versions 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12 of Python.

Check #1: Is Streamlit running?

On a Mac or Linux machine, type this on the terminal:

ps -Al | grep streamlit


If you don't see streamlit run in the output (or streamlit hello, if that's the command you ran) then the Streamlit server is not running. So re-run your command and see if the bug goes away.

Check #2: Is this an already-fixed Streamlit bug?

We try to fix bugs quickly, so many times a problem will go away when you upgrade Streamlit. So the first thing to try when having an issue is upgrading to the latest version of Streamlit:

pip install --upgrade streamlit
streamlit version


...and then verify that the version number printed corresponds to the version number displayed on PyPI.

Try reproducing the issue now. If not fixed, keep reading on.

Check #3: Are you running the correct Streamlit binary?

Let's check whether your Python environment is set up correctly. Edit the Streamlit script where you're experiencing your issue, comment everything out, and add these lines instead:

import streamlit as st
st.write(st.__version__)


...then call streamlit run on your script and make sure it says the same version as above. If not the same version, check out these instructions for some sure-fire ways to set up your environment.

Check #4: Is your browser caching your app too aggressively?

There are two easy ways to check this:

Load your app in a browser then press Ctrl-Shift-R or ‚åò-Shift-R to do a hard refresh (Chrome/Firefox).

As a test, run Streamlit on another port. This way the browser starts the page with a brand new cache. For that, pass the --server.port argument to Streamlit on the command line:

streamlit run my_app.py --server.port=9876

Check #5: Is this a Streamlit regression?

If you've upgraded to the latest version of Streamlit and things aren't working, you can downgrade at any time using this command:

pip install --upgrade streamlit==1.0.0


...where 1.0.0 is the version you'd like to downgrade to. See Changelog for a complete list of Streamlit versions.

Check #6 [Windows]: Is Python added to your PATH?

When installed by downloading from python.org, Python is not automatically added to the Windows system PATH. Because of this, you may get error messages like the following:

Command Prompt:

C:\Users\streamlit> streamlit hello
'streamlit' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.


PowerShell:

PS C:\Users\streamlit> streamlit hello
streamlit : The term 'streamlit' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that
the path is correct and try again.
At line:1 char:1
+ streamlit hello
+ ~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (streamlit:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException


To resolve this issue, add Python to the Windows system PATH.

After adding Python to your Windows PATH, you should then be able to follow the instructions in our Get Started section.

Check #7 [Windows]: Do you need Build Tools for Visual Studio installed?

Streamlit includes pyarrow as an install dependency. Occasionally, when trying to install Streamlit from PyPI, you may see errors such as the following:

Using cached pyarrow-1.0.1.tar.gz (1.3 MB)

How can I make Streamlit watch for changes in other modules I'm importing in my app?

By default, Streamlit only watches modules contained in the current directory of the main app module. You can track other modules by adding the parent directory of each module to the PYTHONPATH.

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/module

How do I run my Streamlit script?
How do I run my Streamlit script?

Working with Streamlit is simple. First you sprinkle a few Streamlit commands into a normal Python script, and then you run it. We list few ways to run your script, depending on your use case.

Use streamlit run

Once you've created your script, say your_script.py, the easiest way to run it is with streamlit run:

streamlit run your_script.py


As soon as you run the script as shown above, a local Streamlit server will spin up and your app will open in a new tab in your default web browser.

Pass arguments to your script

When passing your script some custom arguments, they must be passed after two dashes. Otherwise the arguments get interpreted as arguments to Streamlit itself:

streamlit run your_script.py [-- script args]

Pass a URL to streamlit run

You can also pass a URL to streamlit run! This is great when your script is hosted remotely, such as a GitHub Gist. For example:

streamlit run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamlit/demo-uber-nyc-pickups/master/streamlit_app.py

Run Streamlit as a Python module

Another way of running Streamlit is to run it as a Python module. This is useful when configuring an IDE like PyCharm to work with Streamlit:

# Running
python -m streamlit run your_script.py

# is equivalent to:
streamlit run your_script.py

Share previews

Social media sites generate a card with a title, preview image, and description when you share a link. This feature is called a "share preview." In the same way, when you share a link to a public Streamlit app on social media, a share preview is also generated. Here's an example of a share preview for a public Streamlit app posted on Twitter:

Share preview for a public Streamlit app

push_pin
Note

Share previews are generated only for public apps deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud.

Titles

The title is the text that appears at the top of the share preview. The text also appears in the browser tab when you visit the app. You should set the title to something that will make sense to your app's audience and describe what the app does. It is best practice to keep the title concise, ideally under 60 characters.

There are two ways to set the title of a share preview:

Set the page_title parameter in st.set_page_config() to your desired title. E.g.:

import streamlit as st

st.set_page_config(page_title="My App")

# ... rest of your app


If you don't set the page_title parameter, the title of the share preview will be the name of your app's GitHub repository. For example, the default title for an app hosted on GitHub at github.com/jrieke/traingenerator will be "traingenerator".

Descriptions

The description is the text that appears below the title in the share preview. The description should summarize what the app does and ideally should be under 100 characters.

Streamlit pulls the description from the README in the app's GitHub repository. If there is no README, the description will default to:

This app was built in Streamlit! Check it out and visit https://streamlit.io for more awesome community apps. üéà

Default share preview when a description is missing

If you want your share previews to look great and want users to share your app and click on your links, you should write a good description in the README of your app‚Äôs GitHub repository.

Preview images

Streamlit Community Cloud takes a screenshot of your app once a day and uses it as the preview image, unlike titles and descriptions which are pulled directly from your app's code or GitHub repository. This screenshot may take up to 24 hours to update.

Switching your app from public to private

If you initially made your app public and later decided to make it private, we will stop generating share previews for the app. However, it may take up to 24 hours for the share previews to stop appearing.

Deploy your app

Streamlit Community Cloud lets you deploy your apps in just one click, and most apps will deploy in only a few minutes. If you don't have an app ready to deploy, fork or clone one from our App gallery ‚Äî you can find apps for machine learning, data visualization, data exploration, A/B testing and more. You can also fork and deploy samples straight from the New app button. Once you've deployed your app, check out how you can Edit your app with GitHub Codespaces.

push_pin
Note

If you want to deploy your app on a different cloud service, check out the Deploy Streamlit apps article in our Knowledge Base.

Add your app to GitHub

Streamlit Community Cloud launches apps directly from your GitHub repo, so your app code and dependencies need to be on GitHub before you try to deploy your app. For more information on how to specify dependencies, see App dependencies.

Your directory structure should look similar to this:

your-repository/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ your_app.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt


If you are including any custom Configuration or Theming, make sure your config file is saved relative to the root of your repo. Within your repo, your config file should be named .streamlit/config.toml.

your-repository/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .streamlit/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ your_app.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt

priority_high
Important

Although you can deploy multiple apps from the same repository, there can be only one configuration file.

Deploy your app

From your workspace at share.streamlit.io, click "New app" from the upper-right corner of your workspace.

Fill in your repo, branch, and file path. As a shortcut, you can also click "Paste GitHub URL" to paste a link directly to your_app.py on GitHub.

An app URL with a random hash is prefilled but you can change this to a custom subdomain instead. In the example below, the app would be deployed to https://red-balloon.streamlit.app/. You can always change your subdomain later. See more about Custom subdomains at the end of this page.

Advanced settings for deployment
push_pin
Note

Streamlit Community Cloud supports all released versions of Python that are still receiving security updates. Streamlit Community Cloud defaults to version 3.9. You can select a version of your choice from the "Python version" dropdown in the "Advanced settings" modal. If an app is running a version of Python that becomes unsupported, it will be forcibly upgraded to the oldest, supported version of Python and may break.

(Optional) If you are connecting to a data source or want to specify the Python version for your app, you can do that by clicking "Advanced settings" before you deploy the app. Learn more about Secrets management.

Watch your app launch

Your app is now deploying and you can watch while it launches. Most apps take only a couple of minutes to deploy, but if your app has a lot of dependencies it may take longer to deploy the first time. After the initial deployment, any change that does not touch your dependencies should show up immediately.

push_pin
Note

The Streamlit Community Cloud logs on the right hand side of your app are only viewable to users with developer access to your repository. These logs help you debug any issues with the app. Learn more about Streamlit Community Cloud logs.

Your app URL

That's it ‚Äî you're done! Your app now has a unique subdomain URL that you can share with others. Read more about how to Share your app with viewers.

Unique subdomains

If the "Custom subdomain (optional)" field is blank when you deploy your app, a URL is assigned following a structure based on your GitHub repo. The URL begins with your GitHub username or organization owning your repo, followed by your repo name, app path, and a short hash. If you deploy from a branch other than main or master, the URL also includes the branch name.

https://[GitHub username or organization]-[repo name]-[app path]-[branch name]-[short hash].streamlit.app


For example, this is an app deployed from the streamlit organization. The repo is demo-self-driving and the app name is streamlit_app.py in the root directory. The branch name is master and therefore not included.

https://streamlit-demo-self-driving-streamlit-app-8jya0g.streamlit.app

Custom subdomains

Setting a custom subdomain makes it much easier to share your app since you can choose something memorable. Whether you set a custom subdomain during deployment or later, your app's URL will appear as:

https://<your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app


To view or customize your app subdomain from the dashboard:

Click the overflow icon (more_vert) to the app's right and select "Settings".
View the "General" tab in the App settings modal. Your app's unique subdomain will appear here.
Pick a custom subdomain between 6 and 63 characters in length for your app's URL and hit "Save".

It's that simple! You can then access your app by visiting your customized URL üéâ.

If a custom subdomain is not available (e.g. because it's already taken), you'll see an error message like this:

Search indexability
SEO and search indexability

When you deploy a public app to Streamlit Community Cloud, it is automatically indexed by search engines like Google and Bing on a weekly basis. üéà This means that anyone can find your app by searching for its custom subdomain (e.g. "traingenerator.streamlit.app") or by searching for the app's title.

Get the most out of app indexability

Here are some tips to help you get the most out of app indexability:

Make sure your app is public
Choose a custom subdomain early
Choose a descriptive app title
Customize your app's meta description
Make sure your app is public

All public apps hosted on Streamlit Community Cloud are indexed by search engines. If your app is private, it will not be indexed by search engines. To make your private app public, read Share your app.

Choose a custom subdomain early

Streamlit Community Cloud automatically generates a random subdomain for your app. However, subdomains are customizable! Custom subdomains modify your app URLs to reflect your app content, personal branding, or whatever you‚Äôd like. Read more about custom subdomains in Custom subdomains.

By choosing a custom subdomain, you can use it to help people find your app. For example, if you're deploying an app that generates training data, you might choose a subdomain like traingenerator.streamlit.app. This makes it easy for people to find your app by searching for "training generator" or "train generator streamlit app."

We recommend choosing a custom subdomain when you deploy your app. This ensures that your app is indexed by search engines using your custom subdomain, rather than the automatically generated one. If you choose a custom subdomain later, your app may be indexed multiple times‚Äîonce using the default subdomain and once using your custom subdomain. In this case, your old URL will result in a 404 error which can confuse users who are searching for your app.

Choose a descriptive app title

The meta title of your app is the text that appears in search engine results. It is also the text that appears in the browser tab when your app is open. By default, the meta title of your app is the same as the title of your app. However, you can customize the meta title of your app by setting the st.set_page_config parameter page_title to a custom string. For example:

st.set_page_config(page_title="Traingenerator")


This will change the meta title of your app to "Traingenerator." This makes it easier for people to find your app by searching for "Traingenerator" or "train generator streamlit app":

Google search results for "train generator streamlit app"

Customize your app's meta description

Meta descriptions are the short descriptions that appear in search engine results. Search engines use the meta description to help users understand what your app is about.

From our observations, search engines seem to favor the content in both st.header and st.text over st.title. If you put a description at the top of your app under st.header or st.text, there‚Äôs a good chance search engines will use this for the meta description.

What does my indexed app look like?

If you're curious about what your app looks like in search engine results, you can type the following into Google Search:

site:<your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app


Example: site:traingenerator.streamlit.app

Google search results for "site:traingenerator.streamlit.app"

What if I don't want my app to be indexed?

If you don't want your app to be indexed by search engines, you can make it private. Read Share your app to learn more about making your app private. Note: each workspace can only have one private app. If you want to make your app private, you must first delete any other private app in your workspace or make it public.

That said, Streamlit Community Cloud is an open and free platform for the community to deploy, discover, and share Streamlit apps and code with each other. As such, we encourage you to make your app public so that it can be indexed by search engines and discovered by other Streamlit users and community members.

Update your email

If you wish to update your email on Streamlit Community Cloud, you can do so via your Workspace settings. Updating your email changes the primary identity of your account. Once updated, if your account's email is associated with a Google account, you can sign in with Google OAuth. Otherwise, you through emailed links. The latter involves typing in your email, after which we'll send you a unique, single-use link (valid for 15 minutes).

If you are signed in to GitHub and don't already have a primary identity on your account, see Connect Google to your account.

How to update your email

Sign in to Streamlit Community Cloud at share.streamlit.io.

Click "Settings" in the page's top-right corner. 

Click "Update email" within the "Linked accounts" section. 

Enter your new email and click "Update email." 

You'll see a confirmation dialog asking you to check your email for a confirmation link. Click "Done." 

Your account settings will show "Update pending" until you complete the next step. 

Check your inbox for an email from Streamlit containing a "Change email" button and a confirmation link. This one-time link expires in 15 minutes. Click either one to confirm your new email address for Streamlit Community Cloud. Before doing so, ensure you access the link from the same browser session where you are logged in to Streamlit Community Cloud.

priority_high
Important

If you access the confirmation link from a browser session where you are not logged in to Streamlit Community Cloud, the confirmation link will not complete the process. You will be prompted to sign in. If you try to sign in with your new email, you will create a second account instead. See Troubleshooting.

A confirmation will display to confirm your email update is complete! üéà 

Resend your confirmation link

If your confirmation link expires, don't worry! You can resend it by following these steps:

Sign in to Streamlit Community Cloud at share.streamlit.io and click "Settings" in the page's top-right corner.

Click "Update pending" 

Click "Resend email" 

Continue from step 4 of How to update your email.

Troubleshooting

If you click the confirmation link in a browser session where you are not signed in, you will be informed that "Sign in is required." If you try to sign in with your new email, you will create a second account instead. You cannot resend your confirmation link while you have this second account. If you accidentally created a second account, you can follow the steps to Delete your account to get rid of the duplicate. Afterwards, Resend your confirmation link from your first account.

Connect Google to your account

If you signed up with GitHub and did not create a primary identity, your workspace will show a warning icon in the upper right corner. Click "Settings" to access your workspace settings.

When you access your workspace settings, a warning is displayed: "You are not signed in with a primary identity account." Click "Sign in with Google" and follow Google's authentication prompts.

Your account now has both a primary identity and source control account.

If you did not connect GitHub when you created your account or need to correct your GitHub authorization, this page is for you! If you just need to add an organization to your account, skip ahead to Authorizing with an organization.

If you are not fully logged in and authorized to both a primary identity (Google or email) and source control (GitHub), there will be a warning symbol in the upper-right corner of your workspace. This can mean one of three things:

You are not signed in to a primary identity (Google or email).
See Connect Google to your account.
You are not signed in to source control (GitHub.)
See Connecting GitHub to an existing primary identity.
Your source control has incomplete permissions.
Access your workspace settings see Authorize Streamlit to access private repositories.
Connecting GitHub to an existing primary identity

If you created your account without connecting GitHub or if you disconnected GitHub from your account, you can reconnect.

Click "Settings" in the upper-right corner of your workspace.
If you do not have GitHub connected, a warning is displayed saying, "You are not signed in with a source control account".

If instead you see "Streamlit does not have access to private repos on this GitHub account" skip to step 5. 3. Click "Sign in with GitHub".

Click "Authorize streamlit".
Authorize Streamlit to access private repositories

After completing the first authorization, your workspace settings will still have a warning, "Streamlit does not have access to private repos on this GitHub account".

Click "Allow access".

Click "Authorize streamlit".

GitHub is now connected to your account! ü•≥

Authorizing with an organization

If you are in an organization, you can grant or request access to that organization when you connect your GitHub account. Read more about Organization access.

If your GitHub account is already connected, you can remove permissions in your GitHub settings and force Streamlit to reprompt for GitHub authorization the next time you sign into Streamlit Community Cloud.

Revoke and reauthorize
From your workspace, click on your workspace name in the upper-right corner. Click "Sign out" to sign out of Streamlit Community Cloud.
Go to your GitHub application settings at github.com/settings/applications.
Click on the three dots to open the overflow menu for "Streamlit" and click "Revoke".
Click "I understand, revoke access".
Return to share.streamlit.io and sign in. You will be prompted to authorize GitHub as explained in Connect GitHub.
Granting previously denied access

If an organization owner has restricted Streamlit's access or restricted all OAuth applications, they may need to directly modify their permissions in GitHub. If an organization has restricted Streamlit's access, a red "X" will appear next to the organization when you are prompted to authorize with your GitHub account.

See GitHub's documentation on OAuth apps and organizations.

Streamlit Community Cloud supports a "favorite" feature that lets you quickly access your apps from your workspace. Favorited apps appear at the top of their workspace with a yellow star (star) beside them. You can favorite and unfavorite apps in any workspace to which you have access as a developer or invited viewer.

push_pin
Note

Favorites are specific to your account. Other members of your workspace cannot see which apps you have favorited.

Favoriting and unfavoriting your app

You can favorite your app:

From your workspace.
From your app!
Favorite your app from your workspace

From your workspace at share.streamlit.io, click the overflow icon (more_vert) next to your app. Click "Favorite".

Your favorited app will move to the top of your list (with other favorited apps if you have them) and display with a yellow star.

Once favorited, from the same menu, click "Unfavorite" to remove the star.

Alternatively, you can favorite and unfavorite apps by clicking directly on the star next to their names. (Hover over an unfavorited app to reveal an empty star icon next to its name.)

Favorite your app from your app toolbar

From your app at <your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app, click the star (star_border/star) in the upper-right corner to toggle your app's favorite status.

App analytics

Streamlit Community Cloud allows you to see the viewership of each of your apps. Specifically, you can see:

The total viewers count of your app (counted from April 2022).
The most recent unique viewers (capped up to your last 20 viewers).
A relative timestamp of each unique viewer's last visit.
Access your app analytics

You can get to your app's analytics:

From your workspace.
From your Cloud logs.
Access app analytics from your workspace

From your workspace at share.streamlit.io, click the overflow icon (more_vert) next to your app. Click "Analytics".

Alternatively, from the top of your workspace, click "Analytics".

Access app analytics from your Cloud logs

From your app at <your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app, click "Manage app" in the lower-right corner.

Click the overflow menu icon (more_vert) and click "Analytics".

Switch between apps

Once you are in the analytics modal, you can switch between apps in your workspace from the drop-down list. Remember to switch workspaces if you want to view analytics for an app in another workspace.

App viewers

For public apps, we anonymize all viewers outside your workspace to protect their privacy and display anonymous viewers as random pseudonyms. You'll still be able to see the identities of fellow members in your workspace, including any viewers you've invited (once they've accepted).

priority_high
Important

When you invite a viewer to an app, they gain access to analytics as well. Additionally, if someone is invited as a viewer to any app in your workspace, they can see analytics for all public apps in your workspace and invite additional viewers themselves. A viewer in your workspace may see the emails of developers and other viewers in your workspace through analytics.

Meanwhile, for private apps where you control who has access, you will be able to see the specific users who recently viewed your apps.

Additionally, you may occasionally see anonymous users in a private app. Rest assured, these anonymous users do have authorized view access granted by you or your workspace members.

Common reasons why users show up anonymously are:

The app was previously public.
The given viewer viewed the app in April 2022, when the Streamlit team was honing user identification for this feature.
The given viewer previously disconnected their primary identity (Google or email) and source control identity (GitHub).

Secrets management
Introduction

If you are connecting to data sources, you will likely need to handle credentials or secrets. It's generally considered bad practice to store unencrypted secrets in a git repository. If your application needs access to sensitive credentials the recommended solution is to store those credentials in a file that is not committed to the repository and to pass them as environment variables.

Secrets management allows you to store secrets securely and access them in your Streamlit app as environment variables.

How to use Secrets Management
Deploy an app and set up secrets

From your worksapce at share.streamlit.io, click "New app".

Fill out your app's information and click "Advanced settings..."

A modal will appear with an input box for your secrets.

Provide your secrets in the "Secrets" field using TOML format. For example:

# Everything in this section will be available as an environment variable
db_username = "Jane"
db_password = "12345qwerty"

# You can also add other sections if you like.
# The contents of sections as shown below will not become environment
# variables, but they'll be easily accessible from within Streamlit anyway
# as we show later in this doc.
[my_cool_secrets]
things_i_like = ["Streamlit", "Python"]

Use secrets in your app

Access your secrets as environment variables or by querying the st.secrets dict. For example, if you enter the secrets from the section above, the code below shows you how you can access them within your Streamlit app.

import streamlit as st
import os

# Everything is accessible via the st.secrets dict:
st.write("DB username:", st.secrets["db_username"])
st.write("DB password:", st.secrets["db_password"])
st.write("My cool secrets:", st.secrets["my_cool_secrets"]["things_i_like"])

# And the root-level secrets are also accessible as environment variables:
st.write(
    "Has environment variables been set:",
    os.environ["db_username"] == st.secrets["db_username"],
)

star
Tip

You can access st.secrets via attribute notation (e.g. st.secrets.key) or key notation (e.g. st.secrets["key"]) ‚Äî just like st.session_state.

You can even use TOML sections to compactly pass multiple secrets as a single attribute.

Consider the following secrets:

[db_credentials]
username = "my_username"
password = "my_password"


Rather than passing each secret as attributes in a function, you can more compactly pass the section to achieve the same result. You can use Python's unpacking notation like the following example which uses the secrets above:

# Verbose version
my_db.connect(username=st.secrets.db_credentials.username, password=st.secrets.db_credentials.password)

# Far more compact version!
my_db.connect(**st.secrets.db_credentials)

Edit your app's secrets

If you need to add or edit your secrets for an app that is already deployed, you can access advanced setting from your admin panel.

Go to share.streamlit.io.
Click the overflow menu icon (more_vert) for your app.
Click "Settings". 
A modal will appear. Click "Secrets" on the left. 
After you edit your secrets, click "Save". It might take a minute for the update to be propagated to your app, but the new values will be reflected when the app re-runs.
Develop locally with secrets

When developing your app locally, add a file called secrets.toml in a folder called .streamlit at the root of your app repo, and copy/paste your secrets into that file. Further instructions are available in the Streamlit library Secrets management documentation.

Publish to PyPI

Publishing your Streamlit Component to PyPI makes it easily accessible to Python users around the world. This step is completely optional, so if you won‚Äôt be releasing your component publicly, you can skip this section!

push_pin
Note

For static Streamlit Components, publishing a Python package to PyPI follows the same steps as the core PyPI packaging instructions. A static Component likely contains only Python code, so once you have your setup.py file correct and generate your distribution files, you're ready to upload to PyPI.

Bi-directional Streamlit Components at minimum include both Python and JavaScript code, and as such, need a bit more preparation before they can be published on PyPI. The remainder of this page focuses on the bi-directional Component preparation process.

Prepare your Component

A bi-directional Streamlit Component varies slightly from a pure Python library in that it must contain pre-compiled frontend code. This is how base Streamlit works as well; when you pip install streamlit, you are getting a Python library where the HTML and frontend code contained within it have been compiled into static assets.

The component-template GitHub repo provides the folder structure necessary for PyPI publishing. But before you can publish, you'll need to do a bit of housekeeping:

Give your Component a name, if you haven't already

Rename the template/my_component/ folder to template/<component name>/
Pass your component's name as the the first argument to declare_component()

Edit MANIFEST.in, change the path for recursive-include from package/frontend/build * to <component name>/frontend/build *

Edit setup.py, adding your component's name and other relevant info

Create a release build of your frontend code. This will add a new directory, frontend/build/, with your compiled frontend in it:

cd frontend
npm run export


Pass the build folder's path as the path parameter to declare_component. (If you're using the template Python file, you can set _RELEASE = True at the top of the file):

   import streamlit.components.v1 as components

   # Change this:
   # component = components.declare_component("my_component", url="http://localhost:3001")

   # To this:
   parent_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
   build_dir = os.path.join(parent_dir, "frontend/build")
   component = components.declare_component("new_component_name", path=build_dir)

Build a Python wheel

Once you've changed the default my_component references, compiled the HTML and JavaScript code and set your new component name in components.declare_component(), you're ready to build a Python wheel:

Make sure you have the latest versions of setuptools, wheel, and twine

Create a wheel from the source code:

 # Run this from your component's top-level directory; that is,
 # the directory that contains `setup.py`
 python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

Upload your wheel to PyPI

With your wheel created, the final step is to upload to PyPI. The instructions here highlight how to upload to Test PyPI, so that you can learn the mechanics of the process without worrying about messing anything up. Uploading to PyPI follows the same basic procedure.

Create an account on Test PyPI if you don't already have one

Visit https://test.pypi.org/account/register/ and complete the steps

Visit https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens and create a new API token. Don‚Äôt limit the token scope to a particular project, since you are creating a new project. Copy your token before closing the page, as you won‚Äôt be able to retrieve it again.

Upload your wheel to Test PyPI. twine will prompt you for a username and password. For the username, use __token__. For the password, use your token value from the previous step, including the pypi- prefix:

python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*


Install your newly-uploaded package in a new Python project to make sure it works:

 python -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps example-pkg-YOUR-USERNAME-HERE


If all goes well, you're ready to upload your library to PyPI by following the instructions at https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/#next-steps.

Congratulations, you've created a publicly-available Streamlit Component!

Promote your Component!

App dependencies

The main reason that apps fail to build properly is because Streamlit Community Cloud can't find your dependencies! There are two kinds of dependencies your app might have: Python dependencies and external dependencies. Python dependencies are other Python packages (just like Streamlit!) that you import into you script. External dependencies are less common, but they include any other software your script needs to function properly. Since Streamlit Community Cloud runs on Linux, these will be Linux dependencies installed with apt-get outside the Python environment.

For your dependencies to be installed correctly, make sure you:

Add a¬†requirements file¬†for Python dependencies.
(optional) Add a¬†packages.txt¬†file to manage any external dependencies.
push_pin
Note

Python requirements files should be placed either in the root of your repository or in the same directory as your Streamlit app.

Add Python dependencies

With each import statement in your script, you are bringing in a Python dependency. You need to tell Streamlit Community Cloud how to install those dependencies through a Python package manager. We recommend using a requirements.txt which is based on pip.

You should not include built-in Python libraries like math or random in your requirements.txt file. These are a part of Python and aren't installed separately. Also, Streamlit Community Cloud has streamlit installed by default. You don't strictly need to include streamlit unless you want to pin or restrict the version. If you deploy an app without a requirements.txt file, your app will run in an environment with just streamlit (and its dependencies) installed.

If you have a script like the following, no extra dependencies would be needed since pandas and numpy are installed as direct dependencies of streamlit. Similarly, math and random are built into Python.

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import math
import random

st.write('Hi!')


However, a valid requirements.txt file would be:

streamlit
pandas
numpy


Alternatively, if you needed to specify certain versions, another valid example would be:

streamlit==1.24.1
pandas>2.0
numpy<=1.25.1


In the above example, streamlit is pinned to version 1.24.1, pandas must be strictly greater than version 2.0, and numpy must be at-or-below version 1.25.1. Each line in your requirements.txt file is effectively what you would like to pip install into your cloud environment.

push_pin
Note

We recommend that you use the latest version of Streamlit to ensure full Streamlit Community Cloud functionality. Be sure to take note of Streamlit's current requirements for package compatibility when planning your environment, especially protobuf>=3.20,<5.

If you pin streamlit below 1.20.0, you may experience unexpected results if you've pinned any dependencies of altair. If streamlit is installed below version 1.20.0, altair<5 will be reinstalled on top of your environment for compatibility reasons. When this happens all of altair's dependencies will be updated.

Other Python package managers

There are other Python package managers besides pip. If you want to consider alternatives to using a requirements.txt file, Streamlit Community Cloud will look for other Python dependency managers to use in the order below. Streamlit will stop and install the first dependency file found.

Recognized Filename	Python Package Manager
Pipfile	pipenv
environment.yml	conda
requirements.txt	pip
pyproject.toml	poetry
priority_high
Warning

You should only use one requirements file for your app. If you include more than one (e.g. requirements.txt and Pipfile), only the first file encountered will be used as described above. Additionally, Streamlit will first look in the directory of your Streamlit app; however, if no requirements file is found, Streamlit will then look at the root of the repo.

apt-get dependencies

For many apps, a packages.txt file is not required. However, if your script requires any software to be installed that is not a Python package, then you will need a packages.txt file. Streamlit Community Cloud is built on Debian Linux. Anything you would like to apt-get install needs to go in your packages.txt file.

If packages.txt exists in the root directory of your repository we automatically detect it, parse it, and install the listed packages. You can read more about apt-get in Linux documentation.

Add apt-get dependencies to¬†packages.txt ‚Äî one package name per line. For example, mysqlclient is a Python package which requires additional software be installed to function. A valid packages.txt file to enable mysqlclient would be:

    build-essential
    pkg-config
    default-libmysqlclient-dev

Components API Reference

The first step in developing a Streamlit Component is deciding whether to create a static component (i.e. rendered once, controlled by Python) or to create a bi-directional component that can communicate from Python to JavaScript and back.

Create a static component

If your goal in creating a Streamlit Component is solely to display HTML code or render a chart from a Python visualization library, Streamlit provides two methods that greatly simplify the process: components.html() and components.iframe().

If you are unsure whether you need bi-directional communication, start here first!

Render an HTML string

While st.text, st.markdown and st.write make it easy to write text to a Streamlit app, sometimes you'd rather implement a custom piece of HTML. Similarly, while Streamlit natively supports many charting libraries, you may want to implement a specific HTML/JavaScript template for a new charting library. components.html works by giving you the ability to embed an iframe inside of a Streamlit app that contains your desired output.

Streamlit in Snowflake

Display an HTML string in an iframe.

Function signature
[source]

st.components.v1.html(html, width=None, height=None, scrolling=False)

Parameters

html (str)

The HTML string to embed in the iframe.

width (int)

The width of the frame in CSS pixels. Defaults to the app's default element width.

height (int)

The height of the frame in CSS pixels. Defaults to 150.

scrolling (bool)

If True, show a scrollbar when the content is larger than the iframe. Otherwise, do not show a scrollbar. Defaults to False.

Example

import streamlit as st
import streamlit.components.v1 as components

# bootstrap 4 collapse example

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    """,
    height=600,
)

Render an iframe URL

components.iframe is similar in features to components.html, with the difference being that components.iframe takes a URL as its input. This is used for situations where you want to include an entire page within a Streamlit app.

components.iframe("https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest")

Create a bi-directional component

A bi-directional Streamlit Component has two parts:

A frontend, which is built out of HTML and any other web tech you like (JavaScript, React, Vue, etc.), and gets rendered in Streamlit apps via an iframe tag.
A Python API, which Streamlit apps use to instantiate and talk to that frontend

To make the process of creating bi-directional Streamlit Components easier, we've created a React template and a TypeScript-only template in the Streamlit Component-template GitHub repo. We also provide some example Components in the same repo.

Development Environment Setup

To build a Streamlit Component, you need the following installed in your development environment:

Python 3.8 - Python 3.12
Streamlit 1.11.1 or higher
nodejs
npm or yarn

Clone the component-template GitHub repo, then decide whether you want to use the React.js ("template") or plain TypeScript ("template-reactless") template.

Initialize and build the component template frontend from the terminal:

# React template
template/my_component/frontend
npm install    # Initialize the project and install npm dependencies
npm run start  # Start the Webpack dev server

# or

# TypeScript-only template
template-reactless/my_component/frontend
npm install    # Initialize the project and install npm dependencies
npm run start  # Start the Webpack dev server


From a separate terminal, run the Streamlit app (Python) that declares and uses the component:

# React template
cd template
. venv/bin/activate # or similar to activate the venv/conda environment where Streamlit is installed
pip install -e . # install template as editable package
streamlit run my_component/example.py # run the example

# or

# TypeScript-only template
cd template-reactless
. venv/bin/activate # or similar to activate the venv/conda environment where Streamlit is installed
pip install -e . # install template as editable package
streamlit run my_component/example.py # run the example


After running the steps above, you should see a Streamlit app in your browser that looks like this:

The example app from the template shows how bi-directional communication is implemented. The Streamlit Component displays a button (Python ‚Üí JavaScript), and the end-user can click the button. Each time the button is clicked, the JavaScript front-end increments the counter value and passes it back to Python (JavaScript ‚Üí Python), which is then displayed by Streamlit (Python ‚Üí JavaScript).

Frontend

Because each Streamlit Component is its own webpage that gets rendered into an iframe, you can use just about any web tech you'd like to create that web page. We provide two templates to get started with in the Streamlit Components-template GitHub repo; one of those templates uses React and the other does not.

push_pin
Note

Even if you're not already familiar with React, you may still want to check out the React-based template. It handles most of the boilerplate required to send and receive data from Streamlit, and you can learn the bits of React you need as you go.

If you'd rather not use React, please read this section anyway! It explains the fundamentals of Streamlit ‚Üî Component communication.

React

The React-based template is in template/my_component/frontend/src/MyComponent.tsx.

MyComponent.render() is called automatically when the component needs to be re-rendered (just like in any React app)
Arguments passed from the Python script are available via the this.props.args dictionary:
# Send arguments in Python:
result = my_component(greeting="Hello", name="Streamlit")

// Receive arguments in frontend:
let greeting = this.props.args["greeting"]; // greeting = "Hello"
let name = this.props.args["name"]; // name = "Streamlit"

Use Streamlit.setComponentValue() to return data from the component to the Python script:
// Set value in frontend:
Streamlit.setComponentValue(3.14);

# Access value in Python:
result = my_component(greeting="Hello", name="Streamlit")
st.write("result = ", result) # result = 3.14


When you call Streamlit.setComponentValue(new_value), that new value is sent to Streamlit, which then re-executes the Python script from top to bottom. When the script is re-executed, the call to my_component(...) will return the new value.

From a code flow perspective, it appears that you're transmitting data synchronously with the frontend: Python sends the arguments to JavaScript, and JavaScript returns a value to Python, all in a single function call! But in reality this is all happening asynchronously, and it's the re-execution of the Python script that achieves the sleight of hand.

Use Streamlit.setFrameHeight() to control the height of your component. By default, the React template calls this automatically (see StreamlitComponentBase.componentDidUpdate()). You can override this behavior if you need more control.
There's a tiny bit of magic in the last line of the file: export default withStreamlitConnection(MyComponent) - this does some handshaking with Streamlit, and sets up the mechanisms for bi-directional data communication.
TypeScript-only

The TypeScript-only template is in template-reactless/my_component/frontend/src/MyComponent.tsx.

This template has much more code than its React sibling, in that all the mechanics of handshaking, setting up event listeners, and updating the component's frame height are done manually. The React version of the template handles most of these details automatically.

Towards the bottom of the source file, the template calls Streamlit.setComponentReady() to tell Streamlit it's ready to start receiving data. (You'll generally want to do this after creating and loading everything that the Component relies on.)
It subscribes to Streamlit.RENDER_EVENT to be notified of when to redraw. (This event won't be fired until setComponentReady is called)
Within its onRender event handler, it accesses the arguments passed in the Python script via event.detail.args
It sends data back to the Python script in the same way that the React template does‚Äîclicking on the "Click Me!" button calls Streamlit.setComponentValue()
It informs Streamlit when its height may have changed via Streamlit.setFrameHeight()
Working with Themes
push_pin
Note

Custom component theme support requires streamlit-component-lib version 1.2.0 or higher.

Along with sending an args object to your component, Streamlit also sends a theme object defining the active theme so that your component can adjust its styling in a compatible way. This object is sent in the same message as args, so it can be accessed via this.props.theme (when using the React template) or event.detail.theme (when using the plain TypeScript template).

The theme object has the following shape:

{
  "base": "lightORdark",
  "primaryColor": "someColor1",
  "backgroundColor": "someColor2",
  "secondaryBackgroundColor": "someColor3",
  "textColor": "someColor4",
  "font": "someFont"
}


The base option allows you to specify a preset Streamlit theme that your custom theme inherits from. Any theme config options not defined in your theme settings have their values set to those of the base theme. Valid values for base are "light" and "dark".

Note that the theme object has fields with the same names and semantics as the options in the "theme" section of the config options printed with the command streamlit config show.

When using the React template, the following CSS variables are also set automatically.

--base
--primary-color
--background-color
--secondary-background-color
--text-color
--font


If you're not familiar with CSS variables, the TLDR version is that you can use them like this:

.mySelector {
  color: var(--text-color);
}


These variables match the fields defined in the theme object above, and whether to use CSS variables or the theme object in your component is a matter of personal preference.

Other frontend details
Because you're hosting your component from a dev server (via npm run start), any changes you make should be automatically reflected in the Streamlit app when you save.
If you want to add more packages to your component, run npm add to add them from within your component's frontend/ directory.
npm add baseui

To build a static version of your component, run npm run export. See Prepare your Component for more information
Python API

components.declare_component() is all that's required to create your Component's Python API:

  import streamlit.components.v1 as components
  my_component = components.declare_component(
    "my_component",
    url="http://localhost:3001"
  )


You can then use the returned my_component function to send and receive data with your frontend code:

# Send data to the frontend using named arguments.
return_value = my_component(name="Blackbeard", ship="Queen Anne's Revenge")

# `my_component`'s return value is the data returned from the frontend.
st.write("Value = ", return_value)


While the above is all you need to define from the Python side to have a working Component, we recommend creating a "wrapper" function with named arguments and default values, input validation and so on. This will make it easier for end-users to understand what data values your function accepts and allows for defining helpful docstrings.

Please see this example from the Components-template for an example of creating a wrapper function.

Data serialization
Python ‚Üí Frontend

You send data from Python to the frontend by passing keyword args to your Component's invoke function (that is, the function returned from declare_component). You can send the following types of data from Python to the frontend:

Any JSON-serializable data
numpy.array
pandas.DataFrame

Any JSON-serializable data gets serialized to a JSON string, and deserialized to its JavaScript equivalent. numpy.array and pandas.DataFrame get serialized using Apache Arrow and are deserialized as instances of ArrowTable, which is a custom type that wraps Arrow structures and provides a convenient API on top of them.

Check out the CustomDataframe and SelectableDataTable Component example code for more context on how to use ArrowTable.

Frontend ‚Üí Python

You send data from the frontend to Python via the Streamlit.setComponentValue() API (which is part of the template code). Unlike arg-passing from Python ‚Üí frontend, this API takes a single value. If you want to return multiple values, you'll need to wrap them in an Array or Object.

Custom Components can send JSON-serializable data from the frontend to Python, as well as Apache Arrow ArrowTables to represent dataframes.

If you are only interested in using Streamlit Components, then you can skip this section and head over to the Streamlit Components Gallery to find and install components created by the community!

Developers can write JavaScript and HTML "components" that can be rendered in Streamlit apps. Streamlit Components can receive data from, and also send data to, Streamlit Python scripts.

Streamlit Components let you expand the functionality provided in the base Streamlit package. Use Streamlit Components to create the needed functionality for your use-case, then wrap it up in a Python package and share with the broader Streamlit community!

Types of Streamlit Components you could create include:

Custom versions of existing Streamlit elements and widgets, such as st.slider or st.file_uploader.
Completely new Streamlit elements and widgets by wrapping existing React.js, Vue.js, or other JavaScript widget toolkits.
Rendering Python objects having methods that output HTML, such as IPython __repr_html__.
Convenience functions for commonly-used web features like GitHub gists and Pastebin.

Streamlit trust and security

Streamlit is a framework that turns Python scripts into interactive apps, giving data scientists the ability to quickly create data and model-based apps for the entire company.

A simple Streamlit app is:

import streamlit as st
number = st.slider("Pick a number: ", min_value=1, max_value=10)
st.text("Your number is " + str(number))


When you streamlit run my_app.py, you start a web server that runs the interactive application on your local computer at http://localhost:8501. This is great for local development. When you want to share with your colleagues, Streamlit Community Cloud enables you to deploy and run these applications in the cloud. Streamlit Community Cloud handles the details of containerization and provides you an interface for easily managing your deployed apps.

This document provides an overview of the security safeguards we've implemented to protect you and your data. Security, however, is a shared responsibility and you are ultimately responsible for making appropriate use of Streamlit and the Streamlit Community Cloud, including implementation of appropriate user-configurable security safeguards and best practices.

Product security
Authentication

You must authenticate through GitHub to deploy or administer an app. Authentication through Google or single-use emailed links are required to view a private app when you don't have push or admin permissions on the associated GitHub repository. The single-use emailed links are valid for 15 minutes once requested.

Permissions

Streamlit Community Cloud inherits the permissions you have assigned in GitHub. Users with write access to a GitHub repository for a given app will be able to make changes in the Streamlit administrative console. However, only users with admin access to a repository are able to deploy and delete apps.

Network and application security
Data hosting

Our physical infrastructure is hosted and managed within secure data centers maintained by infrastructure-as-a-service cloud providers. Streamlit leverages many of these platforms' built-in security, privacy, and redundancy features. Our cloud providers continually monitor their data centers for risk and undergo assessments to ensure compliance with industry standards.

Data deletion

Community Cloud users have the option to delete any apps they‚Äôve deployed as well as their entire account.

When a user deletes their application from the admin console, we delete their source code, including any files copied from their GitHub repository or created within our system from the running app. However, we keep a record representing the application in our database. This record contains the coordinates of the application: the GitHub organization or user, the GitHub repository, the branch, and the path of the main module file.

When a user deletes their account, we perform a hard deletion of their data and a hard deletion of all the apps that belong to the GitHub identity associated with their account. In this case, we do not maintain the records of application coordinates described above. When an account is deleted, we also delete any HubSpot contact associated with the Community Cloud account.

Virtual private cloud

All of our servers are within a virtual private cloud (VPC) with firewalls and network access control lists (ACLs) to allow external access to a select few API endpoints; all other internal services are only accessible within the VPC.

Encryption

Streamlit apps are served entirely over HTTPS. We use only strong cipher suites and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to ensure browsers interact with Streamlit apps over HTTPS.

All data sent to or from Streamlit over the public internet is encrypted in transit using 256-bit encryption. Our API and application endpoints use Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 (or better). We also encrypt data at rest on disk using AES-256.

Permissions and authentication

Access to Community Cloud user account data is limited to authorized personnel. We run a zero-trust corporate network, utilize single sign-on and multi-factor authentication (MFA), and enforce strong password policies to ensure access to cloud-related services is protected.

Incident response

Our internal protocol for handling security events includes detection, analysis, response, escalation, and mitigation. Security advisories are made available at https://streamlit.io/advisories.

Penetration testing

Streamlit uses third-party security tools to scan for vulnerabilities on a regular basis. Our security teams conduct periodic, intensive penetration tests on the Streamlit platform. Our product development team responds to any identified issues or potential vulnerabilities to ensure the quality, security, and availability of Streamlit applications.

Vulnerability management

We keep our systems up-to-date with the latest security patches and continuously monitor for new vulnerabilities. This includes automated scanning of our code repositories for vulnerable dependencies.

If you discover a vulnerability in one of our products or websites, please report the issue to HackerOne.

Explore your workspace

If you just created your account, congrats! You are now logged in and ready to go. If you are joining someone else's workspace you may already see apps populated in your workspace. If not, then you need to deploy an app! Check out our next section on how to Deploy your app. If you need an app to deploy, check out our App gallery which includes apps for machine learning, data science, and business use cases.

Switching workspaces

You may also find that you already have access to multiple Streamlit Community Cloud workspaces. Streamlit Community Cloud automatically groups your apps according to the corresponding GitHub repository's owner or organzation. In the upper-right corner you can see the workspaces you have access to. If apps have already been deployed from any of your repositories, then you will see those apps when you select the associated workspace in the upper-right corner. Learn more about how to Manage your app from your workspace.

New app button

Your workspace is your base of operations to deploy apps and manage them. You can click on "New app" to Deploy your app from a repository where you have administrative privileges. If you want additional options, click the down arrow (expand_more) to begin with a template.

"Use existing repo" is the default to Deploy your app from a repository where you have administrative privileges.
"Create from sample app template" will fork and deploy a simple, one-page Streamlit app.
"Create new app with GitHub Codespaces" will fork and deploy our multipage Streamlit Hello app and create a codespace. To jump quickly into GitHub Codespaces for any of your deployed apps, see Edit your app with GitHub Codespaces instead.
Invite other developers to your workspace

Inviting other developers is simple, just invite them to your GitHub repository so that you can code on apps together, and then have them log in to share.streamlit.io/signup. Read more about connecting to a GitHub organization in Organization access.

Streamlit Community Cloud inherits developer permissions from GitHub so when others sign in, they will automatically see the workspaces they share with you. From there you can all deploy, manage, and share apps together.

push_pin
Note

Once a user is added to a repository on GitHub, it will take at most 15 minutes before they can deploy the app on Cloud. If a user is removed from a repository on GitHub, it will take at most 15 minutes before their permissions to manage the app from that repository are revoked.

And remember, whenever anyone on the team updates the code on GitHub, the app will also automatically update for you!

Connect your GitHub account

Connecting GitHub to your Streamlit Community Cloud account allows you to deploy apps directly from the files you store in your repos. It also lets the system check for updates to those files and automatically update your app. There are two stages to this authorization: the first happens when you connect your account for the first time and the second happens when you deploy your first app.

Everyone is prompted to connect GitHub when they create an account. If you need to connect GitHub to an existing primary identity, see Manage your GitHub connection.

This page contains additional information about the authorization needed to connect GitHub. If you have just created your account, you are free to skip ahead and Explore your workspace. GitHub's authorization prompts occur automatically as needed.

Authorize your GitHub account

There are two different authorization prompts to grant access between Streamlit and your GitHub account. The first authorization‚Äî"Authorize Streamlit"‚Äîhappens when you connect your GitHub account to Streamlit. The second authorization‚Äî"Streamlit is requesting additional permissions"‚Äîhappens when you deploy your first app. You must click "Authorize streamlit" on both. If you are a member of any GitHub organizations, read below to understand the extras steps to authorize an organization. Questions about GitHub permissions? Read some frequently asked questions about our GitHub integration.

priority_high
Important

You must have admin permissions to your repo in order to deploy apps. If you don't have admin access, talk to the repo's owner or reach out to us on the Community forum.

Organization access

If you are working in a repository that is owned by an organization, authorization must be granted by that organization. If you are an owner or member of a GitHub organization when you connect your GitHub account, your authorization prompts will include an extra section labeled "Organization access".

Organizations you own

For any organization you own, if authorization has not been previously granted or denied you can click "Grant" before you click "Authorize streamlit".

Organizations owned by others

For an organization you don't own, if authorization has not been previously granted or denied you can click "Request" before you click "Authorize streamlit".

Previous or pending authorization

If someone has already started the process of authorizing Streamlit for your organization, different options and statuses will display accordingly.

Approved access

If an organization has already granted Streamlit access, a green check is shown.

Pending access

If a request has been previously sent but not yet approved, a pending status shows.

Denied access

If a request has been previously sent and denied, no option to grant or request access is shown. In this case, the organization owner will need to authorize Streamlit from GitHub. See GitHub's documentation on OAuth apps and organizations.

What's next?

Now that you have your account you can Explore your workspace. Or if you're ready to go, jump right in and Deploy your app.

Fork and edit a public app

Community Cloud is all about learning, sharing, and exploring the world of Streamlit. For apps with public repositories, you can quickly fork copies to your GitHub account, deploy your own version, and jump into a codespace on GitHub to start editing and exploring Streamlit code ‚Äî all in the cloud so you don't have to install anything.

From a forkable app, in the upper-right corner, click "fork_right Fork this app."

Click "Fork!" The repository will be forked to your GitHub account. If you have already forked the repository or have another repository of the same name, the fork will fail. In this case, you can manually fork the repository on GitHub, then follow the instructions to Deploy your app and Edit your app with GitHub Codespaces.

Click "Create codespace" to confirm the creation of a codespace on your account. Read more about GitHub Codespaces to learn about monthly limits for free use and paid plans.

Wait for GitHub to set up your codespace.

GitHub will automatically execute the commands to launch your Streamlit app within your codespace. Your app will be visible in a "Simple Browser" on the right. This may take a minute to complete from when your codespace first appears on screen.

You now have a copy the public app deployed from your account. You can edit and explore within your codespace and (if you choose) commit your changes to your deployed app to share with the world! üåé Learn more about editing your app in GitHub Codespaces, committing your edits to your repository, and shutting down your codespace in Edit your app with GitHub Codespaces.

Edit your app

You can edit your app from any development environment of your choice. Community Cloud will monitor your repository and automatically copy any file changes you commit. You will immediately see commits reflected in your deployed app for most changes (such as edits to your app's Python files).

Community Cloud also makes it easy to skip the work of setting up a development environment. With a few simple clicks, you can configure a development environment using GitHub Codespaces.

Edit your app with GitHub Codespaces

Spin up a cloud-based development environment for your deployed app in minutes. You can run your app within your codespace to enjoy experimenting in a safe, sandboxed environment. When you are done editing your code, you can commit your changes to your repo or just leave them in your codespace to return to later.

Create a codespace for your deployed app

From your workspace at share.streamlit.io, click the overflow icon (more_vert) next to your app. Click "Edit."

A .devcontainer/devcontainer.json file will be added to your repository. If you already have a file of the same name in your repository, it will not be changed. You may delete or rename your existing devcontainer configuration if you would like your repository to receive the instance created by Streamlit Community Cloud.

Click "Create codespace" to confirm the creation of a codespace on your account. Read more about GitHub Codespaces to learn about monthly limits for free use and paid plans.

Wait for GitHub to set up your codespace.

GitHub will automatically execute the commands to launch your Streamlit app within your codespace. Your app will be visible in a "Simple Browser" on the right. This may take a minute to complete from when your codespace first appears on screen.

When you make changes to your app, the file is automatically saved within your codespace. Your edits do not affect your repository unless you choose to commit those changes. We will describe committing your changes in a later step.

In order to see updates automatically reflected on the right, click "Always rerun" when prompted after an edit.

 

See your edits appear within the "Simple Browser" tab and keep going with more!

Commit your changes to your repository (optional)

After making edits to your app, you can choose to commit your edits to your repository to update your deployed app instantly. If you just want to keep your edits in your codespace to return to later, skip to Stop or delete your codespace.

In the left navigation bar, click the source control icon.

Fill out your desired commit message and click "Commit."

Click "Yes" to stage and commit all your changes. To learn more about source control in GitHub Codespaces, check out Source control in GitHub Docs.

Stop or delete your codespace

When you are done, remember to stop your codespace on GitHub to avoid any undesired use of your capacity.

Go to github.com/codespaces. At the bottom of the page, all your codespaces are listed. Click the overflow menu icon (more_horiz) for your codespace.

Click "Stop codespace" if you'd like to return to your work later. Otherwise, click "Delete."

Custom Components

Components are third-party Python modules that extend what's possible with Streamlit.

How to use a Component

Components are super easy to use:

Start by finding the Component you'd like to use. Two great resources for this are:

The Component gallery
This thread, by Fanilo A. from our forums.

Install the Component using your favorite Python package manager. This step and all following steps are described in your component's instructions.

For example, to use the fantastic AgGrid Component, you first install it with:

pip install streamlit-aggrid


In your Python code, import the Component as described in its instructions. For AgGrid, this step is:

from st_aggrid import AgGrid


...now you're ready to use it! For AgGrid, that's:

AgGrid(my_dataframe)

Making your own Component

If you're interested in making your own component, check out the following resources:

Deprecation notice

st.experimental_memo was deprecated in version 1.18.0. Use st.cache_data instead. Learn more in Caching.

Decorator to cache functions that return data (e.g. dataframe transforms, database queries, ML inference).

Cached objects are stored in "pickled" form, which means that the return value of a cached function must be pickleable. Each caller of the cached function gets its own copy of the cached data.

You can clear a function's cache with func.clear() or clear the entire cache with st.cache_data.clear().

To cache global resources, use st.cache_resource instead. Learn more about caching at https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching.

Function signature
[source]

st.experimental_memo(func=None, *, ttl, max_entries, show_spinner, persist, experimental_allow_widgets, hash_funcs=None)

Parameters

func (callable)

The function to cache. Streamlit hashes the function's source code.

ttl (float, timedelta, str, or None)

The maximum time to keep an entry in the cache. Can be one of:

None if cache entries should never expire (default).
A number specifying the time in seconds.
A string specifying the time in a format supported by Pandas's Timedelta constructor, e.g. "1d", "1.5 days", or "1h23s".
A timedelta object from Python's built-in datetime library, e.g. timedelta(days=1).

Note that ttl will be ignored if persist="disk" or persist=True.

max_entries (int or None)

The maximum number of entries to keep in the cache, or None for an unbounded cache. When a new entry is added to a full cache, the oldest cached entry will be removed. Defaults to None.

show_spinner (bool or str)

Enable the spinner. Default is True to show a spinner when there is a "cache miss" and the cached data is being created. If string, value of show_spinner param will be used for spinner text.

persist ("disk", bool, or None)

Optional location to persist cached data to. Passing "disk" (or True) will persist the cached data to the local disk. None (or False) will disable persistence. The default is None.

experimental_allow_widgets (bool)

Allow widgets to be used in the cached function. Defaults to False. Support for widgets in cached functions is currently experimental. Setting this parameter to True may lead to excessive memory use since the widget value is treated as an additional input parameter to the cache. We may remove support for this option at any time without notice.

hash_funcs (dict or None)

Mapping of types or fully qualified names to hash functions. This is used to override the behavior of the hasher inside Streamlit's caching mechanism: when the hasher encounters an object, it will first check to see if its type matches a key in this dict and, if so, will use the provided function to generate a hash for it. See below for an example of how this can be used.

Example
import streamlit as st

@st.cache_data
def fetch_and_clean_data(url):
    # Fetch data from URL here, and then clean it up.
    return data

d1 = fetch_and_clean_data(DATA_URL_1)
# Actually executes the function, since this is the first time it was
# encountered.

d2 = fetch_and_clean_data(DATA_URL_1)
# Does not execute the function. Instead, returns its previously computed
# value. This means that now the data in d1 is the same as in d2.

d3 = fetch_and_clean_data(DATA_URL_2)
# This is a different URL, so the function executes.
Copy

To set the persist parameter, use this command as follows:

import streamlit as st

@st.cache_data(persist="disk")
def fetch_and_clean_data(url):
    # Fetch data from URL here, and then clean it up.
    return data
Copy

By default, all parameters to a cached function must be hashable. Any parameter whose name begins with _ will not be hashed. You can use this as an "escape hatch" for parameters that are not hashable:

import streamlit as st

@st.cache_data
def fetch_and_clean_data(_db_connection, num_rows):
    # Fetch data from _db_connection here, and then clean it up.
    return data

connection = make_database_connection()
d1 = fetch_and_clean_data(connection, num_rows=10)
# Actually executes the function, since this is the first time it was
# encountered.

another_connection = make_database_connection()
d2 = fetch_and_clean_data(another_connection, num_rows=10)
# Does not execute the function. Instead, returns its previously computed
# value - even though the _database_connection parameter was different
# in both calls.
Copy

A cached function's cache can be procedurally cleared:

import streamlit as st

@st.cache_data
def fetch_and_clean_data(_db_connection, num_rows):
    # Fetch data from _db_connection here, and then clean it up.
    return data

fetch_and_clean_data.clear()
# Clear all cached entries for this function.
Copy

To override the default hashing behavior, pass a custom hash function. You can do that by mapping a type (e.g. datetime.datetime) to a hash function (lambda dt: dt.isoformat()) like this:

import streamlit as st
import datetime

@st.cache_data(hash_funcs={datetime.datetime: lambda dt: dt.isoformat()})
def convert_to_utc(dt: datetime.datetime):
    return dt.astimezone(datetime.timezone.utc)
Copy

Alternatively, you can map the type's fully-qualified name (e.g. "datetime.datetime") to the hash function instead:

import streamlit as st
import datetime

@st.cache_data(hash_funcs={"datetime.datetime": lambda dt: dt.isoformat()})
def convert_to_utc(dt: datetime.datetime):
    return dt.astimezone(datetime.timezone.utc)
Copy

Persistent memo caches currently don't support TTL. ttl will be ignored if persist is specified:

import streamlit as st

@st.experimental_memo(ttl=60, persist="disk")
def load_data():
    return 42

st.write(load_data())


And a warning will be logged to your terminal:

streamlit run app.py

  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

2022-09-22 13:35:41.587 The memoized function 'load_data' has a TTL that will be ignored. Persistent memo caches currently don't support TTL.

Deprecation notice

st.experimental_memo.clear was deprecated in version 1.18.0. Use st.cache_data.clear instead. Learn more in Caching.

Clear all in-memory and on-disk data caches.

Function signature
[source]

st.experimental_memo.clear()

Example

In the example below, pressing the "Clear All" button will clear memoized values from all functions decorated with @st.experimental_memo.

import streamlit as st

@st.experimental_memo
def square(x):
    return x**2

@st.experimental_memo
def cube(x):
    return x**3

if st.button("Clear All"):
    # Clear values from *all* memoized functions:
    # i.e. clear values from both square and cube
    st.experimental_memo.clear()

Replay static
st
elements in cache-decorated functions

Functions decorated with @st.experimental_memo can contain static st elements. When a cache-decorated function is executed, we record the element and block messages produced, so the elements will appear in the app even when execution of the function is skipped because the result was cached.

In the example below, the @st.experimental_memo decorator is used to cache the execution of the load_data function, that returns a pandas DataFrame. Notice the cached function also contains a st.area_chart command, which will be replayed when the function is skipped because the result was cached.

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

@st.experimental_memo
def load_data(rows):
    chart_data = pd.DataFrame(
        np.random.randn(rows, 10),
        columns=["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"],
    )
    # Contains a static element st.area_chart
    st.area_chart(chart_data) # This will be recorded and displayed even when the function is skipped
    return chart_data

df = load_data(20)
st.dataframe(df)


Supported static st elements in cache-decorated functions include:

st.alert
st.altair_chart
st.area_chart
st.audio
st.bar_chart
st.ballons
st.bokeh_chart
st.caption
st.code
st.components.v1.html
st.components.v1.iframe
st.container
st.dataframe
st.echo
st.empty
st.error
st.exception
st.expander
st.experimental_get_query_params
st.experimental_set_query_params
st.form
st.form_submit_button
st.graphviz_chart
st.help
st.image
st.info
st.json
st.latex
st.line_chart
st.markdown
st.metric
st.plotly_chart
st.progress
st.pydeck_chart
st.snow
st.spinner
st.success
st.table
st.text
st.vega_lite_chart
st.video
st.warning
Replay input widgets in cache-decorated functions

In addition to static elements, functions decorated with @st.experimental_memo can also contain input widgets! Replaying input widgets is disabled by default. To enable it, you can set the experimental_allow_widgets parameter for @st.experimental_memo to True. The example below enables widget replaying, and shows the use of a checkbox widget within a cache-decorated function.

import streamlit as st

# Enable widget replay
@st.experimental_memo(experimental_allow_widgets=True)
def func():
    # Contains an input widget
    st.checkbox("Works!")

func()


If the cache decorated function contains input widgets, but experimental_allow_widgets is set to False or unset, Streamlit will throw a CachedStFunctionWarning, like the one below:

import streamlit as st

# Widget replay is disabled by default
@st.experimental_memo
def func():
    # Streamlit will throw a CachedStFunctionWarning
    st.checkbox("Doesn't work")

func()

How widget replay works

Let's demystify how widget replay in cache-decorated functions works and gain a conceptual understanding. Widget values are treated as additional inputs to the function, and are used to determine whether the function should be executed or not. Consider the following example:

import streamlit as st

@st.experimental_memo(experimental_allow_widgets=True)
def plus_one(x):
    y = x + 1
    if st.checkbox("Nuke the value üí•"):
        st.write("Value was nuked, returning 0")
        y = 0
    return y

st.write(plus_one(2))


The plus_one function takes an integer x as input, and returns x + 1. The function also contains a checkbox widget, which is used to "nuke" the value of x. i.e. the return value of plus_one depends on the state of the checkbox: if it is checked, the function returns 0, otherwise it returns 3.

In order to know which value the cache should return (in case of a cache hit), Streamlit treats the checkbox state (checked / unchecked) as an additional input to the function plus_one (just like x). If the user checks the checkbox (thereby changing its state), we look up the cache for the same value of x (2) and the same checkbox state (checked). If the cache contains a value for this combination of inputs, we return it. Otherwise, we execute the function and store the result in the cache.

Let's now understand how enabling and disabling widget replay changes the behavior of the function.

Widget replay disabled
Widgets in cached functions throw a CachedStFunctionWarning and are ignored.
Other static elements in cached functions replay as expected.
Widget replay enabled
Widgets in cached functions don't lead to a warning, and are replayed as expected.
Interacting with a widget in a cached function will cause the function to be executed again, and the cache to be updated.
Widgets in cached functions retain their state across reruns.
Each unique combination of widget values is treated as a separate input to the function, and is used to determine whether the function should be executed or not. i.e. Each unique combination of widget values has its own cache entry; the cached function runs the first time and the saved value is used afterwards.
Calling a cached function multiple times in one script run with the same arguments triggers a DuplicateWidgetID error.
If the arguments to a cached function change, widgets from that function that render again retain their state.
Changing the source code of a cached function invalidates the cache.
Both st.experimental_memo and st.experimental_singleton support widget replay.
Fundamentally, the behavior of a function with (supported) widgets in it doesn't change when it is decorated with @st.experimental_memo or @st.experimental_singleton. The only difference is that the function is only executed when we detect a cache "miss".
Supported widgets

All input widgets are supported in cache-decorated functions. The following is an exhaustive list of supported widgets:

st.button
st.camera_input
st.checkbox
st.color_picker
st.date_input
st.download_button
st.file_uploader

Embed your app

Embedding Streamlit Community Cloud apps enriches your content by integrating interactive, data-driven applications directly within your pages. Whether you're writing a blog post, a technical document, or sharing resources on platforms like Medium, Notion, or even StackOverflow, embedding Streamlit apps adds a dynamic component to your content. This allows your audience to interact with your ideas, rather than merely reading about them or looking at screenshots.

Streamlit Community Cloud supports both iframe and oEmbed methods for embedding public apps. This flexibility enables you to share your apps across a wide array of platforms, broadening your app's visibility and impact. In this guide, we'll cover how to use both methods effectively to share your Streamlit apps with the world.

Embedding with iframes

Streamlit Community Cloud supports embedding¬†public¬†apps using the subdomain scheme. To embed a public app, add the query parameter¬†/?embed=true¬†to the end of the¬†*.streamlit.app¬†URL.

For example, say you want to embed the 30DaysOfStreamlit app. The URL to include in your iframe is: https://30days.streamlit.app/?embed=true:

<iframe
  src="https://30days.streamlit.app/?embed=true"
  height="450"
  style={{ width: "100%", border: "none" }}
></iframe>

priority_high
Important

There will be no official support for embedding private apps.

In addition to allowing you to embed apps via iframes, the¬†?embed=true¬†query parameter also does the following:

Removes the toolbar with the app menu icon (more_vert).
Removes the padding at the top and bottom of the app.
Removes the footer.
Removes the colored line from the top of the app.

For granular control over the embedding behavior, Streamlit allows you to specify one or more instances of the ?embed_options query parameter (e.g. to show the toolbar, open the app in dark theme, etc). Click here for a full list of Embed options.

Embedding with oEmbed

Streamlit's oEmbed support allows for a simpler embedding experience. You can directly drop a Streamlit app's URL into a Medium, Ghost, or Notion page (or any of more than 700 content providers that supports oEmbed or embed.ly). The embedded app will automatically appear! This helps Streamlit Community Cloud apps seamlessly integrate into these platforms, improving the visibility and accessibility of your apps.

Example

When creating content in a Notion page, Medium article, or Ghost blog, you only need to paste the app's URL and hit "Enter". The app will then render automatically at that spot in your content. You can use your undecorated app URL without the ?embed=true query parameter.

https://30days.streamlit.app/


Here's an example of @chrieke's Prettymapp app embedded in a Medium article:

star
Tip

Ensure the platform hosting the embedded Streamlit app supports oEmbed or embed.ly.

Key Sites for oEmbed

oEmbed should work out of the box for several platforms including but not limited to:

Medium
Notion
Looker
Tableau
Ghost
Discourse
StackOverflow
W3
Reddit

Please check the specific platform's documentation to verify support for oEmbed.

iframe versus oEmbed

The only noteworthy differences between the methods is that iframing allows you to customize the app's embedding behavior (e.g. showing the toolbar, opening the app in dark theme, etc) using the various ?embed_options described in the next section.

Embed options

When Embedding with iframes, Streamlit allows you to specify one or more instances of the ?embed_options query parameter for granular control over the embedding behavior.

Both¬†?embed¬†and¬†?embed_options¬†are invisible to¬†st.query_params and its precursors, st.experimental_get_query_params and¬†st.experimental_set_query_params. You can't get or set their values.

The supported values for¬†?embed_options¬†are listed below:

Show the toolbar at the top right of the app which includes the app menu (more_vert), running man, and link to GitHub.

/?embed=true&embed_options=show_toolbar


Show padding at the top and bottom of the app.

/?embed=true&embed_options=show_padding


Show the footer reading "Made with Streamlit." (This doesn't apply to Streamlit versions 1.29.0 and later since the footer was removed from the library.)

/?embed=true&embed_options=show_footer


Show the colored line at the top of the app.

/?embed=true&embed_options=show_colored_line


Hide the "skeleton" that appears while an app is loading.

/?embed=true&embed_options=hide_loading_screen


Disable scrolling for the main body of the app. (The sidebar will still be scrollable.)

/?embed=true&embed_options=disable_scrolling


Open the app with light theme.

/?embed=true&embed_options=light_theme


Open the app with dark theme.

/?embed=true&embed_options=dark_theme


You can also combine the params:

/?embed=true&embed_options=show_toolbar&embed_options=show_padding&embed_options=show_footer&embed_options=show_colored_line&embed_options=disable_scrolling

Build an embed link

You can conveniently build an embed link for your app ‚Äî right from your app!

From your app at <your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app, click "Share" in the upper-right corner.

Click "Embed" to access a list of selectable embed options.

Select your embed options and click "Get embed link" to copy the embed link to your clipboard.

Deprecation notice

st.experimental_singleton was deprecated in version 1.18.0. Use st.cache_resource instead. Learn more in Caching.

Decorator to cache functions that return global resources (e.g. database connections, ML models).

Cached objects are shared across all users, sessions, and reruns. They must be thread-safe because they can be accessed from multiple threads concurrently. If thread safety is an issue, consider using st.session_state to store resources per session instead.

You can clear a function's cache with func.clear() or clear the entire cache with st.cache_resource.clear().

To cache data, use st.cache_data instead. Learn more about caching at https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching.

Function signature
[source]

st.experimental_singleton(func, *, ttl, max_entries, show_spinner, validate, experimental_allow_widgets, hash_funcs=None)

Parameters

func (callable)

The function that creates the cached resource. Streamlit hashes the function's source code.

ttl (float, timedelta, str, or None)

The maximum time to keep an entry in the cache. Can be one of:

None if cache entries should never expire (default).
A number specifying the time in seconds.
A string specifying the time in a format supported by Pandas's Timedelta constructor, e.g. "1d", "1.5 days", or "1h23s".
A timedelta object from Python's built-in datetime library, e.g. timedelta(days=1).

max_entries (int or None)

The maximum number of entries to keep in the cache, or None for an unbounded cache. When a new entry is added to a full cache, the oldest cached entry will be removed. Defaults to None.

show_spinner (bool or str)

Enable the spinner. Default is True to show a spinner when there is a "cache miss" and the cached resource is being created. If string, value of show_spinner param will be used for spinner text.

validate (callable or None)

An optional validation function for cached data. validate is called each time the cached value is accessed. It receives the cached value as its only parameter and it must return a boolean. If validate returns False, the current cached value is discarded, and the decorated function is called to compute a new value. This is useful e.g. to check the health of database connections.

experimental_allow_widgets (bool)

Allow widgets to be used in the cached function. Defaults to False. Support for widgets in cached functions is currently experimental. Setting this parameter to True may lead to excessive memory use since the widget value is treated as an additional input parameter to the cache. We may remove support for this option at any time without notice.

hash_funcs (dict or None)

Mapping of types or fully qualified names to hash functions. This is used to override the behavior of the hasher inside Streamlit's caching mechanism: when the hasher encounters an object, it will first check to see if its type matches a key in this dict and, if so, will use the provided function to generate a hash for it. See below for an example of how this can be used.

Example
import streamlit as st

@st.cache_resource
def get_database_session(url):
    # Create a database session object that points to the URL.
    return session

s1 = get_database_session(SESSION_URL_1)
# Actually executes the function, since this is the first time it was
# encountered.

s2 = get_database_session(SESSION_URL_1)
# Does not execute the function. Instead, returns its previously computed
# value. This means that now the connection object in s1 is the same as in s2.

s3 = get_database_session(SESSION_URL_2)
# This is a different URL, so the function executes.
Copy

By default, all parameters to a cache_resource function must be hashable. Any parameter whose name begins with _ will not be hashed. You can use this as an "escape hatch" for parameters that are not hashable:

import streamlit as st

@st.cache_resource
def get_database_session(_sessionmaker, url):
    # Create a database connection object that points to the URL.
    return connection

s1 = get_database_session(create_sessionmaker(), DATA_URL_1)
# Actually executes the function, since this is the first time it was
# encountered.

s2 = get_database_session(create_sessionmaker(), DATA_URL_1)
# Does not execute the function. Instead, returns its previously computed
# value - even though the _sessionmaker parameter was different
# in both calls.
Copy

A cache_resource function's cache can be procedurally cleared:

import streamlit as st

@st.cache_resource
def get_database_session(_sessionmaker, url):
    # Create a database connection object that points to the URL.
    return connection

get_database_session.clear()
# Clear all cached entries for this function.
Copy

To override the default hashing behavior, pass a custom hash function. You can do that by mapping a type (e.g. Person) to a hash function (str) like this:

import streamlit as st
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Person(BaseModel):
    name: str

@st.cache_resource(hash_funcs={Person: str})
def get_person_name(person: Person):
    return person.name
Copy

Alternatively, you can map the type's fully-qualified name (e.g. "__main__.Person") to the hash function instead:

import streamlit as st
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Person(BaseModel):
    name: str

@st.cache_resource(hash_funcs={"__main__.Person": str})
def get_person_name(person: Person):
    return person.name

Deprecation notice

st.experimental_singleton.clear was deprecated in version 1.18.0. Use st.cache_resource.clear instead. Learn more in Caching.

Clear all cache_resource caches.

Function signature
[source]

st.experimental_singleton.clear()

Example

In the example below, pressing the "Clear All" button will clear all singleton caches. i.e. Clears cached singleton objects from all functions decorated with @st.experimental_singleton.

import streamlit as st
from transformers import BertModel

@st.experimental_singleton
 def get_database_session(url):
     # Create a database session object that points to the URL.
     return session

@st.experimental_singleton
def get_model(model_type):
    # Create a model of the specified type.
    return BertModel.from_pretrained(model_type)

if st.button("Clear All"):
    # Clears all singleton caches:
    st.experimental_singleton.clear()

Validating the cache

The @st.experimental_singleton decorator is used to cache the output of a function, so that it only needs to be executed once. This can improve performance in certain situations, such as when a function takes a long time to execute or makes a network request.

However, in some cases, the cached output may become invalid over time, such as when a database connection times out. To handle this, the @st.experimental_singleton decorator supports an optional validate parameter, which accepts a validation function that is called each time the cached output is accessed. If the validation function returns False, the cached output is discarded and the decorated function is executed again.

Best Practices
Use the validate parameter when the cached output may become invalid over time, such as when a database connection or an API key expires.
Use the validate parameter judiciously, as it will add an additional overhead of calling the validation function each time the cached output is accessed.
Make sure that the validation function is as fast as possible, as it will be called each time the cached output is accessed.
Consider to validate cached data periodically, instead of each time it is accessed, to mitigate the performance impact.
Handle errors that may occur during validation and provide a fallback mechanism if the validation fails.
Replay static
st
elements in cache-decorated functions

Functions decorated with @st.experimental_singleton can contain static st elements. When a cache-decorated function is executed, we record the element and block messages produced, so the elements will appear in the app even when execution of the function is skipped because the result was cached.

In the example below, the @st.experimental_singleton decorator is used to cache the execution of the get_model function, that returns a ü§ó Hugging Face Transformers model. Notice the cached function also contains a st.bar_chart command, which will be replayed when the function is skipped because the result was cached.

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
from transformers import AutoModel

@st.experimental_singleton
def get_model(model_type):
    # Contains a static element st.bar_chart
    st.bar_chart(
        np.random.rand(10, 1)
    )  # This will be recorded and displayed even when the function is skipped

    # Create a model of the specified type
    return AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_type)

bert_model = get_model("distilbert-base-uncased")
st.help(bert_model) # Display the model's docstring

Replay input widgets in cache-decorated functions

In addition to static elements, functions decorated with @st.experimental_singleton can also contain input widgets! Replaying input widgets is disabled by default. To enable it, you can set the experimental_allow_widgets parameter for @st.experimental_singleton to True. The example below enables widget replaying, and shows the use of a checkbox widget within a cache-decorated function.

import streamlit as st

# Enable widget replay
@st.experimental_singleton(experimental_allow_widgets=True)
def func():
    # Contains an input widget
    st.checkbox("Works!")

func()


If the cache decorated function contains input widgets, but experimental_allow_widgets is set to False or unset, Streamlit will throw a CachedStFunctionWarning, like the one below:

import streamlit as st

# Widget replay is disabled by default
@st.experimental_singleton
def func():
    # Streamlit will throw a CachedStFunctionWarning
    st.checkbox("Doesn't work")

func()

How widget replay works

Let's demystify how widget replay in cache-decorated functions works and gain a conceptual understanding. Widget values are treated as additional inputs to the function, and are used to determine whether the function should be executed or not. Consider the following example:

import streamlit as st

@st.experimental_singleton(experimental_allow_widgets=True)
def plus_one(x):
    y = x + 1
    if st.checkbox("Nuke the value üí•"):
        st.write("Value was nuked, returning 0")
        y = 0
    return y

st.write(plus_one(2))


The plus_one function takes an integer x as input, and returns x + 1. The function also contains a checkbox widget, which is used to "nuke" the value of x. i.e. the return value of plus_one depends on the state of the checkbox: if it is checked, the function returns 0, otherwise it returns 3.

In order to know which value the cache should return (in case of a cache hit), Streamlit treats the checkbox state (checked / unchecked) as an additional input to the function plus_one (just like x). If the user checks the checkbox (thereby changing its state), we look up the cache for the same value of x (2) and the same checkbox state (checked). If the cache contains a value for this combination of inputs, we return it. Otherwise, we execute the function and store the result in the cache.

Let's now understand how enabling and disabling widget replay changes the behavior of the function.

Widget replay disabled
Widgets in cached functions throw a CachedStFunctionWarning and are ignored.
Other static elements in cached functions replay as expected.
Widget replay enabled
Widgets in cached functions don't lead to a warning, and are replayed as expected.
Interacting with a widget in a cached function will cause the function to be executed again, and the cache to be updated.
Widgets in cached functions retain their state across reruns.
Each unique combination of widget values is treated as a separate input to the function, and is used to determine whether the function should be executed or not. i.e. Each unique combination of widget values has its own cache entry; the cached function runs the first time and the saved value is used afterwards.
Calling a cached function multiple times in one script run with the same arguments triggers a DuplicateWidgetID error.
If the arguments to a cached function change, widgets from that function that render again retain their state.
Changing the source code of a cached function invalidates the cache.
Both st.experimental_singleton and st.experimental_memo support widget replay.
Fundamentally, the behavior of a function with (supported) widgets in it doesn't change when it is decorated with @st.experimental_singleton or @st.experimental_memo. The only difference is that the function is only executed when we detect a cache "miss".
Supported widgets

All input widgets are supported in cache-decorated functions. The following is an exhaustive list of supported widgets:

st.button
st.camera_input
st.checkbox
st.color_picker
st.date_input
st.download_button
st.file_uploader
st.multiselect
st.number_input

Connect Streamlit to Snowflake
Introduction

This guide explains how to securely access a Snowflake database from Streamlit. It uses st.connection, the Snowpark library and Streamlit's Secrets management. The below example code will only work on Streamlit version >= 1.28, when st.connection was added.

Create a Snowflake database
push_pin
Note

If you already have a database that you want to use, feel free to skip to the next step.

First, sign up for Snowflake and log into the Snowflake web interface (note down your username, password, and account identifier!):

Enter the following queries into the SQL editor in the Worksheets page to create a database and a table with some example values:

CREATE DATABASE PETS;

CREATE TABLE MYTABLE (
    NAME            varchar(80),
    PET             varchar(80)
);

INSERT INTO MYTABLE VALUES ('Mary', 'dog'), ('John', 'cat'), ('Robert', 'bird');

SELECT * FROM MYTABLE;


Before you execute the queries, first determine which Snowflake UI / web interface you're using. The examples below use Snowsight. You can also use Classic Console Worksheets or any other means of running Snowflake SQL statements.

Execute queries in a Worksheet

To execute the queries in a Worksheet, highlight or select all the queries with your mouse, and click the play button in the top right corner.

priority_high
Important

Be sure to highlight or select all the queries (lines 1-10) before clicking the play button.

Once you have executed the queries, you should see a preview of the table in the Results panel at the bottom of the page. Additionally, you should see your newly created database and schema by expanding the accordion on the left side of the page. Lastly, the warehouse name is displayed on the button to the left of the Share button.

Make sure to note down the name of your warehouse, database, and schema. ‚òùÔ∏è

Install snowflake-snowpark-python

You can find the instructions and prerequisites for installing snowflake-snowpark-python in the Snowflake Developer Guide.

pip install snowflake-snowpark-python

Add connection parameters to your local app secrets

Your local Streamlit app will read secrets from a file .streamlit/secrets.toml in your app‚Äôs root directory. Learn more about Streamlit secrets management here. Create this file if it doesn‚Äôt exist yet and add your Snowflake username, password, account identifier, and the name of your warehouse, database, and schema as shown below:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml

[connections.snowflake]
account = "xxx"
user = "xxx"
password = "xxx"
role = "xxx"
warehouse = "xxx"
database = "xxx"
schema = "xxx"
client_session_keep_alive = true


If you created the database from the previous step, the names of your database and schema are PETS and PUBLIC, respectively. Streamlit will also use Snowflake config and credentials from a SnowSQL config file if available.

priority_high
Important

Add this file to .gitignore and don't commit it to your GitHub repo!

Write your Streamlit app

Copy the code below to your Streamlit app and run it. Make sure to adapt the query to use the name of your table.

# streamlit_app.py

import streamlit as st

# Initialize connection.
conn = st.connection("snowflake")

# Perform query.
df = conn.query("SELECT * from mytable;", ttl=600)

# Print results.
for row in df.itertuples():
    st.write(f"{row.NAME} has a :{row.PET}:")


See st.connection above? This handles secrets retrieval, setup, query caching and retries. By default, query() results are cached without expiring. In this case, we set ttl=600 to ensure the query result is cached for no longer than 10 minutes. You can also set ttl=0 to disable caching. Learn more in Caching.

If everything worked out (and you used the example table we created above), your app should look like this:

Using a Snowpark Session

The same SnowflakeConnection used above also provides access to the Snowpark Session for DataFrame-style operations that run natively inside Snowflake. Using this approach, you can rewrite the app above as follows:

# streamlit_app.py

import streamlit as st

# Initialize connection.
conn = st.connection("snowflake")

# Load the table as a dataframe using the Snowpark Session.
@st.cache_data
def load_table():
    session = conn.session()
    return session.table("mytable").to_pandas()

df = load_table()

# Print results.
for row in df.itertuples():
    st.write(f"{row.NAME} has a :{row.PET}:")


If everything worked out (and you used the example table we created above), your app should look the same as the screenshot from the first example above.

Connecting to Snowflake from Community Cloud

This tutorial assumes a local Streamlit app, however you can also connect to Snowflake from apps hosted in Community Cloud. The main additional steps are:

Include information about dependencies using a requirements.txt file with snowflake-snowpark-python and any other dependencies.
Add your secrets to your Community Cloud app.

App menu

Streamlit provides a configurable menu within your app to access convenient tools for developers and viewers. By default, you can access developer options from the app menu when viewing an app locally or on Streamlit Community Cloud while logged into an account with administrative access. While viewing an app, click the icon in the upper-right corner to access the menu.

Menu options

The menu is split into two sections. The upper section contains options available to all viewers and the lower section contains options for developers. Read more about customizing this menu at the end of this page.

Rerun

You can manually trigger a rerun of your app by clicking "Rerun" from the app menu. This rerun will not reset your session. Your widget states and values stored in st.session_state will be preserved. As a shortcut, without opening the app menu, you can rerun your app by pressing "R" on your keyboard (if you aren't currently focused on an input element).

Settings

With the "Settings" option, you can control the appearance of your app while it is running. If viewing the app locally, you can set how your app responds to changes in your source code. See more about development flow in Main concepts. You can also force your app to appear in wide mode, even if not set within the script using st.set_page_config.

Theme settings

After clicking "Settings" from the app menu, you can choose between "Light", "Dark", or "Use system setting" for the app's base theme. Click on "Edit active theme" to modify the theme, color-by-color.



Print

Click "Print" to open a print dialog. This option uses your browser's built-in print-to-pdf function.

Record a screencast

You can easily make screen recordings right from your app! Screen recording is supported in the latest versions of Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. Ensure your browser is up-to-date for compatibility. Depending on your current settings, you may need to grant permission to your browser to record your screen or to use your microphone if recording a voiceover.

While viewing your app, open the app menu from the upper-right corner.
Click "Record a screencast."
If you want to record audio through your microphone, check "Also record audio."
Click "Start recording." (You may be prompted by your OS to permit your browser to record your screen or use your microphone.)
Select which tab, window, or monitor you want to record from the listed options. The interface will vary depending on your browser.
Click "Share."
While recording, you will see a red circle on your app's tab and on the app menu icon. If you want to cancel the recording, click "Stop sharing" at the bottom of your app.
When you are done recording, press "Esc" on your keyboard or click "Stop recording" from your app's menu.
Follow your browser's instructions to save your recording. Your saved recording will be available where your browser saves downloads.

The whole process looks like this:

About

You can conveniently check what version of Streamlit is running from the "About" option. Developers also have the option to customize the message shown here using st.set_page_config.

Developer options

By default, developer options only show when viewing an app locally or when viewing a Community Cloud app while logged in with administrative permission. You can customize the menu if you want to make these options available for all users.

Clear cache

Reset your app's cache by clicking "Clear cache" from the app's menu or by pressing "C" on your keyboard while not focused on an input element. This will remove all cached entries for @st.cache_data and @st.cache_resource.

Deploy this app

If you are running an app locally from within a git repo, you can deploy your app to Streamlit Community Cloud in a few easy clicks! Make sure your work has been pushed to your online GitHub repository before beginning. For the greatest convenience, make sure you have already created your Community Cloud account and are signed in.

Click "Deploy" next to the app menu icon (more_vert).
Click "Deploy now".
You will be taken to Community Cloud's "Deploy an app" page. Your app's repository, branch, and file name will be prefilled to match your current app! Learn more about deploying an app on Streamlit Community Cloud.

The whole process looks like this:

Customize the menu

Using client.toolbarMode in your app's configuration, you can make the app menu appear in the following ways:

"developer" ‚Äî Show the developer options to all viewers.
"viewer" ‚Äî Hide the developer options from all viewers.
"minimal" ‚Äî Show only those options set externally. These options can be declared through st.set_page_config or populated through Streamlit Community Cloud.
"auto" ‚Äî This is the default and will show the developer options when accessed through localhost or through Streamlit Community Cloud when logged into an administrative account for the app. Otherwise, the developer options will not show.

Build a basic LLM chat app
Introduction

The advent of large language models like GPT has revolutionized the ease of developing chat-based applications. Streamlit offers several Chat elements, enabling you to build Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for conversational agents or chatbots. Leveraging session state along with these elements allows you to construct anything from a basic chatbot to a more advanced, ChatGPT-like experience using purely Python code.

In this tutorial, we'll start by walking through Streamlit's chat elements, st.chat_message and st.chat_input. Then we'll proceed to construct three distinct applications, each showcasing an increasing level of complexity and functionality:

First, we'll Build a bot that mirrors your input to get a feel for the chat elements and how they work. We'll also introduce session state and how it can be used to store the chat history. This section will serve as a foundation for the rest of the tutorial.
Next, you'll learn how to Build a simple chatbot GUI with streaming.
Finally, we'll Build a ChatGPT-like app that leverages session state to remember conversational context, all within less than 50 lines of code.

Here's a sneak peek of the LLM-powered chatbot GUI with streaming we'll build in this tutorial:

Play around with the above demo to get a feel for what we'll build in this tutorial. A few things to note:

There's a chat input at the bottom of the screen that's always visible. It contains some placeholder text. You can type in a message and press Enter or click the run button to send it.
When you enter a message, it appears as a chat message in the container above. The container is scrollable, so you can scroll up to see previous messages. A default avatar is displayed to your messages' left.
The assistant's responses are streamed to the frontend and are displayed with a different default avatar.

Before we start building, let's take a closer look at the chat elements we'll use.

Chat elements

Streamlit offers several commands to help you build conversational apps. These chat elements are designed to be used in conjunction with each other, but you can also use them separately.

st.chat_message lets you insert a chat message container into the app so you can display messages from the user or the app. Chat containers can contain other Streamlit elements, including charts, tables, text, and more. st.chat_input lets you display a chat input widget so the user can type in a message.

For an overview of the API, check out this video tutorial by Chanin Nantasenamat (@dataprofessor), a Senior Developer Advocate at Streamlit.

st.chat_message

st.chat_message lets you insert a multi-element chat message container into your app. The returned container can contain any Streamlit element, including charts, tables, text, and more. To add elements to the returned container, you can use with notation.

st.chat_message's first parameter is the name of the message author, which can be either "user" or "assistant" to enable preset styling and avatars, like in the demo above. You can also pass in a custom string to use as the author name. Currently, the name is not shown in the UI but is only set as an accessibility label. For accessibility reasons, you should not use an empty string.

Here's an minimal example of how to use st.chat_message to display a welcome message:

import streamlit as st

with st.chat_message("user"):
    st.write("Hello üëã")




Notice the message is displayed with a default avatar and styling since we passed in "user" as the author name. You can also pass in "assistant" as the author name to use a different default avatar and styling, or pass in a custom name and avatar. See the API reference for more details.

import streamlit as st
import numpy as np

with st.chat_message("assistant"):
    st.write("Hello human")
    st.bar_chart(np.random.randn(30, 3))


While we've used the preferred with notation in the above examples, you can also just call methods directly in the returned objects. The below example is equivalent to the one above:

import streamlit as st
import numpy as np

message = st.chat_message("assistant")
message.write("Hello human")
message.bar_chart(np.random.randn(30, 3))


So far, we've displayed predefined messages. But what if we want to display messages based on user input?

st.chat_input

st.chat_input lets you display a chat input widget so the user can type in a message. The returned value is the user's input, which is None if the user hasn't sent a message yet. You can also pass in a default prompt to display in the input widget. Here's an example of how to use st.chat_input to display a chat input widget and show the user's input:

import streamlit as st

prompt = st.chat_input("Say something")
if prompt:
    st.write(f"User has sent the following prompt: {prompt}")


Pretty straightforward, right? Now let's combine st.chat_message and st.chat_input to build a bot the mirrors or echoes your input.

Build a bot that mirrors your input

In this section, we'll build a bot that mirrors or echoes your input. More specifically, the bot will respond to your input with the same message. We'll use st.chat_message to display the user's input and st.chat_input to accept user input. We'll also use session state to store the chat history so we can display it in the chat message container.

First, let's think about the different components we'll need to build our bot:

Two chat message containers to display messages from the user and the bot, respectively.
A chat input widget so the user can type in a message.
A way to store the chat history so we can display it in the chat message containers. We can use a list to store the messages, and append to it every time the user or bot sends a message. Each entry in the list will be a dictionary with the following keys: role (the author of the message), and content (the message content).
import streamlit as st

st.title("Echo Bot")

# Initialize chat history
if "messages" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.messages = []

# Display chat messages from history on app rerun
for message in st.session_state.messages:
    with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
        st.markdown(message["content"])


In the above snippet, we've added a title to our app and a for loop to iterate through the chat history and display each message in the chat message container (with the author role and message content). We've also added a check to see if the messages key is in st.session_state. If it's not, we initialize it to an empty list. This is because we'll be adding messages to the list later on, and we don't want to overwrite the list every time the app reruns.

Now let's accept user input with st.chat_input, display the user's message in the chat message container, and add it to the chat history.

# React to user input
if prompt := st.chat_input("What is up?"):
    # Display user message in chat message container
    with st.chat_message("user"):
        st.markdown(prompt)
    # Add user message to chat history
    st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})


We used the := operator to assign the user's input to the prompt variable and checked if it's not None in the same line. If the user has sent a message, we display the message in the chat message container and append it to the chat history.

All that's left to do is add the chatbot's responses within the if block. We'll use the same logic as before to display the bot's response (which is just the user's prompt) in the chat message container and add it to the history.

response = f"Echo: {prompt}"
# Display assistant response in chat message container
with st.chat_message("assistant"):
    st.markdown(response)
# Add assistant response to chat history
st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})


Putting it all together, here's the full code for our simple chatbot GUI and the result:

expand_more

While the above example is very simple, it's a good starting point for building more complex conversational apps. Notice how the bot responds instantly to your input. In the next section, we'll add a delay to simulate the bot "thinking" before responding.

Build a simple chatbot GUI with streaming

In this section, we'll build a simple chatbot GUI that responds to user input with a random message from a list of pre-determind responses. In the next section, we'll convert this simple toy example into a ChatGPT-like experience using OpenAI.

Just like previously, we still require the same components to build our chatbot. Two chat message containers to display messages from the user and the bot, respectively. A chat input widget so the user can type in a message. And a way to store the chat history so we can display it in the chat message containers.

Let's just copy the code from the previous section and add a few tweaks to it.

import streamlit as st
import random
import time

st.title("Simple chat")

# Initialize chat history
if "messages" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.messages = []

# Display chat messages from history on app rerun
for message in st.session_state.messages:
    with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
        st.markdown(message["content"])

# Accept user input
if prompt := st.chat_input("What is up?"):
    # Display user message in chat message container
    with st.chat_message("user"):
        st.markdown(prompt)
    # Add user message to chat history
    st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})


The only difference so far is we've changed the title of our app and added imports for random and time. We'll use random to randomly select a response from a list of responses and time to add a delay to simulate the chatbot "thinking" before responding.

All that's left to do is add the chatbot's responses within the if block. We'll use a list of responses and randomly select one to display. We'll also add a delay to simulate the chatbot "thinking" before responding (or stream its response).

# Display assistant response in chat message container
with st.chat_message("assistant"):
    message_placeholder = st.empty()
    full_response = ""
    assistant_response = random.choice(
        [
            "Hello there! How can I assist you today?",
            "Hi, human! Is there anything I can help you with?",
            "Do you need help?",
        ]
    )
    # Simulate stream of response with milliseconds delay
    for chunk in assistant_response.split():
        full_response += chunk + " "
        time.sleep(0.05)
        # Add a blinking cursor to simulate typing
        message_placeholder.markdown(full_response + "‚ñå")
    message_placeholder.markdown(full_response)
# Add assistant response to chat history
st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": full_response})


Above, we've added a placeholder to display the chatbot's response. We've also added a for loop to iterate through the response and display it one word at a time. We've added a delay of 0.05 seconds between each word to simulate the chatbot "thinking" before responding. Finally, we append the chatbot's response to the chat history. As you've probably guessed, this is a naive implementation of streaming. We'll see how to implement streaming with OpenAI in the next section.

Putting it all together, here's the full code for our simple chatbot GUI and the result:

Play around with the above demo to get a feel for what we've built. It's a very simple chatbot GUI, but it has all the components of a more sophisticated chatbot. In the next section, we'll see how to build a ChatGPT-like app using OpenAI.

Build a ChatGPT-like app

Now that you've understood the basics of Streamlit's chat elements, let's make a few tweaks to it to build our own ChatGPT-like app. You'll need to install the OpenAI Python library and get an API key to follow along.

Install dependencies

First let's install the dependencies we'll need for this section:

pip install openai streamlit

Add OpenAI API key to Streamlit secrets

Next, let's add our OpenAI API key to Streamlit secrets. We do this by creating .streamlit/secrets.toml file in our project directory and adding the following lines to it:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml
OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"

Write the app

Now let's write the app. We'll use the same code as before, but we'll replace the list of responses with a call to the OpenAI API. We'll also add a few more tweaks to make the app more ChatGPT-like.

import streamlit as st
from openai import OpenAI

st.title("ChatGPT-like clone")

# Set OpenAI API key from Streamlit secrets
client = OpenAI(api_key=st.secrets["OPENAI_API_KEY"])

# Set a default model
if "openai_model" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state["openai_model"] = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

# Initialize chat history
if "messages" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.messages = []

# Display chat messages from history on app rerun
for message in st.session_state.messages:
    with st.chat_message(message["role"]):
        st.markdown(message["content"])

# Accept user input
if prompt := st.chat_input("What is up?"):
    # Add user message to chat history
    st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})
    # Display user message in chat message container
    with st.chat_message("user"):
        st.markdown(prompt)
    # Display assistant response in chat message container
    with st.chat_message("assistant"):
        message_placeholder = st.empty()
        full_response = ""


All that's changed is that we've added a default model to st.session_state and set our OpenAI API key from Streamlit secrets. Here's where it gets interesting. We can replace our logic from earlier to emulate streaming predetermined responses with the model's responses from OpenAI:

    for response in client.chat.completions.create(
        model=st.session_state["openai_model"],
        messages=[{"role": m["role"], "content": m["content"]} for m in st.session_state.messages],
        stream=True,
    ):
        full_response += (response.choices[0].delta.content or "")
        message_placeholder.markdown(full_response + "‚ñå")
    message_placeholder.markdown(full_response)
st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": full_response})


Above, we've replaced the list of responses with a call to OpenAI().chat.completions.create. We've set stream=True to stream the responses to the frontend. In the API call, we pass the model name we hardcoded in session state and pass the chat history as a list of messages. We also pass the role and content of each message in the chat history. Finally, OpenAI returns a stream of responses (split into chunks of tokens), which we iterate through and display each chunk.

Putting it all together, here's the full code for our ChatGPT-like app and the result:

Dataframes

Dataframes are a great way to display and edit data in a tabular format. Working with Pandas DataFrames and other tabular data structures is key to data science workflows. If developers and data scientists want to display this data in Streamlit, they have multiple options: st.dataframe and st.data_editor. If you want to solely display data in a table-like UI, st.dataframe is the way to go. If you want to interactively edit data, use st.data_editor. We explore the use cases and advantages of each option in the following sections.

Display dataframes with st.dataframe

Streamlit can display dataframes in a table-like UI via st.dataframe :

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(
    [
        {"command": "st.selectbox", "rating": 4, "is_widget": True},
        {"command": "st.balloons", "rating": 5, "is_widget": False},
        {"command": "st.time_input", "rating": 3, "is_widget": True},
    ]
)

st.dataframe(df, use_container_width=True)

st.dataframe
UI features

st.dataframe provides additional functionality by using glide-data-grid under the hood:

Column sorting: Sort columns by clicking on their headers.
Column resizing: Resize columns by dragging and dropping column header borders.
Table resizing: Resize tables by dragging and dropping the bottom right corner.
Fullscreen view: Enlarge tables to fullscreen by clicking the fullscreen icon (fullscreen) in the toolbar.
Search: Click the search icon (search) in the toolbar or use hotkeys (‚åò+F¬†or¬†Ctrl+F) to search through the data.
Download: Click the download icon in the toolbar to download the data as a CSV file.
Copy to clipboard: Select one or multiple cells, copy them to the clipboard (‚åò+C¬†or¬†Ctrl+C), and paste them into your favorite spreadsheet software.

Try out all the UI features using the embedded app from the prior section.

In addition to Pandas DataFrames, st.dataframe also supports other common Python types, e.g., list, dict, or numpy array. It also supports Snowpark and PySpark DataFrames, which allow you to lazily evaluate and pull data from databases. This can be useful for working with large datasets.

Edit data with st.data_editor

Streamlit supports editable dataframes via the st.data_editor command. Check out its API in st.data_editor. It shows the dataframe in a table, similar to st.dataframe. But in contrast to st.dataframe, this table isn't static! The user can click on cells and edit them. The edited data is then returned on the Python side. Here's an example:

df = pd.DataFrame(
    [
        {"command": "st.selectbox", "rating": 4, "is_widget": True},
        {"command": "st.balloons", "rating": 5, "is_widget": False},
        {"command": "st.time_input", "rating": 3, "is_widget": True},
    ]
)

df = load_data()
edited_df = st.data_editor(df) # üëà An editable dataframe

favorite_command = edited_df.loc[edited_df["rating"].idxmax()]["command"]
st.markdown(f"Your favorite command is **{favorite_command}** üéà")


Try it out by double-clicking on any cell. You'll notice you can edit all cell values. Try editing the values in the rating column and observe how the text output at the bottom changes:

st.data_editor
UI features

st.data_editor also supports a few additional things:

Add and delete rows: You can do this by setting num_rows= "dynamic" when calling st.data_editor. This will allow users to add and delete rows as needed.
Copy and paste support: Copy and paste both between st.data_editor and spreadsheet software like Google Sheets and Excel.
Access edited data: Access only the individual edits instead of the entire edited data structure via Session State.
Bulk edits: Similar to Excel, just drag a handle to edit neighboring cells.
Automatic input validation: Column Configuration provides strong data type support and other configurable options. For example, there's no way to enter letters into a number cell. Number cells can have a designated min and max.
Edit common data structures: st.data_editor supports lists, dicts, NumPy ndarray, and more!
Add and delete rows

With st.data_editor, viewers can add or delete rows via the table UI. This mode can be activated by setting the¬†num_rows parameter to¬†"dynamic":

edited_df = st.data_editor(df, num_rows="dynamic")

To add new rows, click the plus icon (add) in the toolbar. Alternatively, click inside a shaded cell below the bottom row of the table.
To delete rows, select one or more rows using the checkboxes on the left. Click the delete icon (delete) or press the delete key on your keyboard.
Copy and paste support

The data editor supports pasting in tabular data from Google Sheets, Excel, Notion, and many other similar tools. You can also copy-paste data between¬†st.data_editor instances. This functionality, powered by the Clipboard API, can be a huge time saver for users who need to work with data across multiple platforms. To try it out:

Copy data from¬†this Google Sheets document¬†to your clipboard.
Single click any cell in the¬†name¬†column in the app above. Paste it in using hotkeys (‚åò+V¬†or¬†Ctrl+V).
push_pin
Note

Every cell of the pasted data will be evaluated individually and inserted into the cells if the data is compatible with the column type. For example, pasting in non-numerical text data into a number column will be ignored.

Tip

If you embed your apps with iframes, you'll need to allow the iframe to access the clipboard if you want to use the copy-paste functionality. To do so, give the iframe clipboard-write and clipboard-read permissions. E.g.

<iframe allow="clipboard-write;clipboard-read;" ... src="https://your-app-url"></iframe>


As developers, ensure the app is served with a valid, trusted certificate when using TLS. If users encounter issues with copying and pasting data, direct them to check if their browser has activated clipboard access permissions for the Streamlit application, either when prompted or through the browser's site settings.

Access edited data

Sometimes, it is more convenient to know which cells have been changed rather than getting the entire edited dataframe back. Streamlit makes this easy through the use of Session State. If a key parameter is set, Streamlit will store any changes made to the dataframe in Session State.

This snippet shows how you can access changed data using Session State:

st.data_editor(df, key="my_key", num_rows="dynamic") # üëà Set a key
st.write("Here's the value in Session State:")
st.write(st.session_state["my_key"]) # üëà Show the value in Session State


In this code snippet, the key parameter is set to "my_key". After the data editor is created, the value associated to "my_key" in Session State is displayed in the app using st.write. This shows the additions, edits, and deletions that were made.

This can be useful when working with large dataframes and you only need to know which cells have changed, rather than access the entire edited dataframe.

Use all we've learned so far and apply them to the above embedded app. Try editing cells, adding new rows, and deleting rows.

Notice how edits to the table are reflected in Session State. When you make any edits, a rerun is triggered which sends the edits to the backend. The widget's state is a JSON object containing three properties: edited_rows, added_rows, and deleted rows:.

priority_high
Warning

When going from st.experimental_data_editor to st.data_editor in 1.23.0, the data editor's representation in st.session_state was changed. The edited_cells dictionary is now called edited_rows and uses a different format ({0: {"column name": "edited value"}} instead of {"0:1": "edited value"}). You may need to adjust your code if your app uses st.experimental_data_editor in combination with st.session_state."

edited_rows is a dictionary containing all edits. Keys are zero-based row indices and values are dictionaries that map column names to edits (e.g. {0: {"col1": ..., "col2": ...}}).
added_rows is a list of newly added rows. Each value is a dictionary with the same format as above (e.g. [{"col1": ..., "col2": ...}]).
deleted_rows is a list of row numbers that have been deleted from the table (e.g. [0, 2]).

st.data_editor does not support reordering rows, so added rows will always be appended to the end of the dataframe with any edits and deletions applicable to the original rows.

Bulk edits

The data editor includes a feature that allows for bulk editing of cells. Similar to Excel, you can drag a handle across a selection of cells to edit their values in bulk. You can even apply commonly used keyboard shortcuts in spreadsheet software. This is useful when you need to make the same change across multiple cells, rather than editing each cell individually.

Edit common data structures

Editing doesn't just work for Pandas DataFrames! You can also edit lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, NumPy arrays, or Snowpark & PySpark DataFrames. Most data types will be returned in their original format. But some types (e.g. Snowpark and PySpark) are converted to Pandas DataFrames. To learn about all the supported types, read the st.data_editor API.

For example, you can easily let the user add items to a list:

edited_list = st.data_editor(["red", "green", "blue"], num_rows= "dynamic")
st.write("Here are all the colors you entered:")
st.write(edited_list)


Or numpy arrays:

import numpy as np

st.data_editor(np.array([
	["st.text_area", "widget", 4.92],
	["st.markdown", "element", 47.22]
]))


Or lists of records:

st.data_editor([
    {"name": "st.text_area", "type": "widget"},
    {"name": "st.markdown", "type": "element"},
])


Or dictionaries and many more types!

st.data_editor({
	"st.text_area": "widget",
	"st.markdown": "element"
})

Automatic input validation

The data editor includes automatic input validation to help prevent errors when editing cells. For example, if you have a column that contains numerical data, the input field will automatically restrict the user to only entering numerical data. This helps to prevent errors that could occur if the user were to accidentally enter a non-numerical value. Additional input validation can be configured through the Column configuration API. Keep reading below for an overview of column configuration, including validation options.

Configuring columns

You can configure the display and editing behavior of columns in st.dataframe and st.data_editor via the Column configuration API. We have developed the API to let you add images, charts, and clickable URLs in dataframe and data editor columns. Additionally, you can make individual columns editable, set columns as categorical and specify which options they can take, hide the index of the dataframe, and much more.

Column configuration includes the following column types: Text, Number, Checkbox, Selectbox, Date, Time, Datetime, List, Link, Image, Line chart, Bar chart, and Progress. There is also a generic Column option. See the embedded app below to view these different column types. Each column type is individually previewed in the Column configuration API documentation.

Format values

A format parameter is available in column configuration for Text, Date, Time, and Datetime columns. Chart-like columns can also be formatted. Line chart and Bar chart columns have a y_min and y_max parameters to set the vertical bounds. For a Progress column, you can declare the horizontal bounds with min_value and max_value.

Validate input

When specifying a column configuration, you can declare not only the data type of the column but also value restrictions. All column configuration elements allow you to make a column required with the keyword parameter required=True.

For Text and Link columns, you can specify the maximum number of characters with max_chars or use regular expressions to validate entries through validate. Numerical columns, including Number, Date, Time, and Datetime have min_value and max_value parameters. Selectbox columns have a configurable list of options.

The data type for Number columns is float by default. Passing a value of type int to any of min_value, max_value, step, or default will set the type for the column as int.

Configure an empty dataframe

You can use st.data_editor to collect tabular input from a user. When starting from an empty dataframe, default column types are text. Use column configuration to specify the data types you want to collect from users.

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(columns=['name','age','color'])
colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'indigo', 'violet']
config = {
    'name' : st.column_config.TextColumn('Full Name (required)', width='large', required=True),
    'age' : st.column_config.NumberColumn('Age (years)', min_value=0, max_value=122),
    'color' : st.column_config.SelectboxColumn('Favorite Color', options=colors)
}

result = st.data_editor(df, column_config = config, num_rows='dynamic')

if st.button('Get results'):
    st.write(result)

Additional formatting options

In addition to column configuration, st.dataframe and st.data_editor have a few more parameters to customize the display of your dataframe.

hide_index : Set to True to hide the dataframe's index.
column_order : Pass a list of column labels to specify the order of display.
disabled : Pass a list of column labels to disable them from editing. This let's you avoid disabling them individually.
Handling large datasets

st.dataframe and st.data_editor have been designed to theoretically handle tables with millions of rows thanks to their highly performant implementation using the glide-data-grid library and HTML canvas. However, the maximum amount of data that an app can realistically handle will depend on several other factors, including:

The maximum size of WebSocket messages: Streamlit's WebSocket messages are configurable via the server.maxMessageSize config option, which limits the amount of data that can be transferred via the WebSocket connection at once.
The server memory: The amount of data that your app can handle will also depend on the amount of memory available on your server. If the server's memory is exceeded, the app may become slow or unresponsive.
The user's browser memory: Since all the data needs to be transferred to the user's browser for rendering, the amount of memory available on the user's device can also affect the app's performance. If the browser's memory is exceeded, it may crash or become unresponsive.

In addition to these factors, a slow network connection can also significantly slow down apps that handle large datasets.

When handling large datasets with more than 150,000 rows, Streamlit applies additional optimizations and disables column sorting. This can help to reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed at once and improve the app's performance.

Limitations
Streamlit casts all column names to strings internally, so st.data_editor will return a DataFrame where all column names are strings.
The dataframe toolbar is not currently configurable.
While Streamlit's data editing capabilities offer a lot of functionality, editing is enabled for a limited set of column types (TextColumn, NumberColumn, LinkColumn, CheckboxColumn, SelectboxColumn, DateColumn, TimeColumn, and DatetimeColumn). We are actively working on supporting editing for other column types as well, such as images, lists, and charts.
Almost all editable datatypes are supported for index editing. However, pandas.CategoricalIndex and pandas.MultiIndex are not supported for editing.
Sorting is not supported for st.data_editor when num_rows="dynamic".
Sorting is deactivated to optimize performance on large datasets with more than 150,000 rows.

We are continually working to improve Streamlit's handling of DataFrame and add functionality to data editing, so keep an eye out for updates.

Understanding widget behavior

Widgets (like st.button, st.selectbox, and st.text_input) are at the heart of Streamlit apps. They are the interactive elements of Streamlit that pass information from your users into your Python code. Widgets are magical and often work how you want, but they can have surprising behavior in some situations. Understanding the different parts of a widget and the precise order in which events occur helps you achieve your desired results.

This guide covers advanced concepts about widgets. Generally, it begins with simpler concepts and increases in complexity. For most beginning users, these details won't be important to know right away. When you want to dynamically change widgets or preserve widget information between pages, these concepts will be important to understand. We recommend having a basic understanding of Session State before reading this guide.

üéà TL;DR
expand_more
Anatomy of a widget

There are four parts to keep in mind when using widgets:

The frontend component as seen by the user.
The backend value or value as seen through st.session_state.
The key of the widget used to access its value via st.session_state.
The return value given by the widget's function.
Widgets are session dependent

Widget states are dependent on a particular session (browser connection). The actions of one user do not affect the widgets of any other user. Furthermore, if a user opens up multiple tabs to access an app, each tab will be a unique session. Changing a widget in one tab will not affect the same widget in another tab.

Widgets return simple Python data types

The value of a widget as seen through st.session_state and returned by the widget function are of simple Python types. For example, st.button returns a boolean value and will have the same boolean value saved in st.session_state if using a key. The first time a widget function is called (before a user interacts with it), it will return its default value. (e.g. st.selectbox returns the first option by default.) Default values are configurable for all widgets with a few special exceptions like st.button and st.file_uploader.

Keys help distinguish widgets and access their values

Widget keys serve two purposes:

Distinguishing two otherwise identical widgets.
Creating a means to access and manipulate the widget's value through st.session_state.

Whenever possible, Streamlit updates widgets incrementally on the frontend instead of rebuilding them with each rerun. This means Streamlit assigns an ID to each widget from the arguments passed to the widget function. A widget's ID is based on parameters such as label, min or max value, default value, placeholder text, help text, and key. The page where the widget appears also factors into a widget's ID. If you have two widgets of the same type with the same arguments on the same page, you will get a DuplicateWidgetID error. In this case, assign unique keys to the two widgets.

Streamlit can't understand two identical widgets on the same page
# This will cause a DuplicateWidgetID error.
st.button("OK")
st.button("OK")

Use keys to distinguish otherwise identical widgets
st.button("OK", key="privacy")
st.button("OK", key="terms")

Order of operations

When a user interacts with a widget, the order of logic is:

Its value in st.session_state is updated.
The callback function (if any) is executed.
The page reruns with the widget function returning its new value.

If the callback function writes anything to the screen, that content will appear above the rest of the page. A callback function runs as a prefix to the script rerunning. Consequently, that means anything written via a callback function will disappear as soon as the user performs their next action. Other widgets should generally not be created within a callback function.

push_pin
Note

If a callback function is passed any args or kwargs, those arguments will be established when the widget is rendered. In particular, if you want to use a widget's new value in its own callback function, you cannot pass that value to the callback function via the args parameter; you will have to assign a key to the widget and look up its new value using a call to st.session_state within the callback function.

Using callback functions with forms

Using a callback function with a form requires consideration of this order of operations.

import streamlit as st

if "attendance" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.attendance = set()


def take_attendance():
    if st.session_state.name in st.session_state.attendance:
        st.info(f"{st.session_state.name} has already been counted.")
    else:
        st.session_state.attendance.add(st.session_state.name)


with st.form(key="my_form"):
    st.text_input("Name", key="name")
    st.form_submit_button("I'm here!", on_click=take_attendance)

Statefulness of widgets

As long as the defining parameters of a widget remain the same and that widget is continuously rendered on the frontend, then it will be stateful and remember user input.

Changing parameters of a widget will reset it

If any of the defining parameters of a widget change, Streamlit will see it as a new widget and it will reset. The use of manually assigned keys and default values is particularly important in this case. Note that callback functions, callback args and kwargs, label visibility, and disabling a widget do not affect a widget's identity.

In this example, we have a slider whose min and max values are changed. Try interacting with each slider to change its value then change the min or max setting to see what happens.

import streamlit as st

cols = st.columns([2, 1, 2])
minimum = cols[0].number_input("Minimum", 1, 5)
maximum = cols[2].number_input("Maximum", 6, 10, 10)

st.slider("No default, no key", minimum, maximum)
st.slider("No default, with key", minimum, maximum, key="a")
st.slider("With default, no key", minimum, maximum, value=5)
st.slider("With default, with key", minimum, maximum, value=5, key="b")

Updating a slider with no default value

For the first two sliders above, as soon as the min or max value is changed, the sliders reset to the min value. The changing of the min or max value makes them "new" widgets from Streamlit's perspective and so they are recreated from scratch when the app reruns with the changed parameters. Since no default value is defined, each widget will reset to its min value. This is the same with or without a key since it's seen as a new widget either way. There is a subtle point to understand about pre-existing keys connecting to widgets. This will be explained further down in Widget life cycle.

Updating a slider with a default value

For the last two sliders above, a change to the min or max value will result in the widgets being seen as "new" and thus recreated like before. Since a default value of 5 is defined, each widget will reset to 5 whenever the min or max is changed. This is again the same (with or without a key).

A solution to Retain statefulness when changing a widget's parameters is provided further on.

Widgets do not persist when not continually rendered

If a widget's function is not called during a script run, then none of its parts will be retained, including its value in st.session_state. If a widget has a key and you navigate away from that widget, its key and associated value in st.session_state will be deleted. Even temporarily hiding a widget will cause it to reset when it reappears; Streamlit will treat it like a new widget. You can either interrupt the Widget clean-up process (described at the end of this page) or save the value to another key.

Save widget values in Session State to preserve them between pages

If you want to navigate away from a widget and return to it while keeping its value, use a separate key in st.session_state to save the information independently from the widget. In this example, a temporary key is used with a widget. The temporary key uses an underscore prefix. Hence, _my_key is used as the widget key, but the data is copied to my_key to preserve it between pages.

import streamlit as st

def save_value():
    # Copy the value to the permanent key
    st.session_state["my_key"] = st.session_state["_my_key"]

# Copy the saved value to the temporary key
st.session_state["_my_key"] = st.session_state["my_key"]
st.number_input("Number of filters", key="_my_key", on_change=save_value)


If this is functionalized to work with multiple widgets, it could look something like this:

import streamlit as st

def save_value(key):
    st.session_state[key] = st.session_state["_"+key]
def get_value(key):
    st.session_state["_"+key] = st.session_state[key]

get_value("my_key")
st.number_input("Number of filters", key="_my_key", on_change=save_value, args="my_key")


Widget life cycle

When a widget function is called, Streamlit will check if it already has a widget with the same parameters. Streamlit will reconnect if it thinks the widget already exists. Otherwise, it will make a new one.

As mentioned earlier, Streamlit determines a widget's ID based on parameters such as label, min or max value, default value, placeholder text, help text, and key. The page name also factors into a widget's ID. On the other hand, callback functions, callback args and kwargs, label visibility, and disabling a widget do not affect a widget's identity.

Calling a widget function when the widget doesn't already exist

If your script rerun calls a widget function with changed parameters or calls a widget function that wasn't used on the last script run:

Streamlit will build the frontend and backend parts of the widget.
If the widget has been assigned a key, Streamlit will check if that key already exists in Session State.
a. If it exists and is not currently associated with another widget, Streamlit will attach to that key and take on its value for the widget.
b. Otherwise, it will assign the default value to the key in st.session_state (creating a new key-value pair or overwriting an existing one).
If there are args or kwargs for a callback function, they are computed and saved at this point in time.
The default value is then returned by the function.

Step 2 can be tricky. If you have a widget:

st.number_input("Alpha",key="A")


and you change it on a page rerun to:

st.number_input("Beta",key="A")


Streamlit will see that as a new widget because of the label change. The key "A" will be considered part of the widget labeled "Alpha" and will not be attached as-is to the new widget labeled "Beta". Streamlit will destroy st.session_state.A and recreate it with the default value.

If a widget attaches to a pre-existing key when created and is also manually assigned a default value, you will get a warning if there is a disparity. If you want to control a widget's value through st.session_state, initialize the widget's value through st.session_state and avoid the default value argument to prevent conflict.

Calling a widget function when the widget already exists

When rerunning a script without changing a widget's parameters:

Streamlit will connect to the existing frontend and backend parts.
If the widget has a key that was deleted from st.session_state, then Streamlit will recreate the key using the current frontend value. (e.g Deleting a key will not revert the widget to a default value.)
It will return the current value of the widget.
Widget clean-up process

When Streamlit gets to the end of a script run, it will delete the data for any widgets it has in memory that were not rendered on the screen. Most importantly, that means Streamlit will delete all key-value pairs in st.session_state associated with a widget not currently on screen.

Additional examples

As promised, let's address how to retain the statefulness of widgets when changing pages or modifying their parameters. There are two ways to do this.

Use dummy keys to duplicate widget values in st.session_state and protect the data from being deleted along with the widget.
Interrupt the widget clean-up process.

The first method was shown above in Save widget values in Session State to preserve them between pages

Interrupting the widget clean-up process

To retain information for a widget with key="my_key", just add this to the top of every page:

st.session_state.my_key = st.session_state.my_key


When you manually save data to a key in st.session_state, it will become detached from any widget as far as the clean-up process is concerned. If you navigate away from a widget with some key "my_key" and save data to st.session_state.my_key on the new page, you will interrupt the widget clean-up process and prevent the key-value pair from being deleted or overwritten if another widget with the same key exists.

Retain statefulness when changing a widget's parameters

Here is a solution to our earlier example of changing a slider's min and max values. This solution interrupts the clean-up process as described above.

import streamlit as st

# Set default value
if "a" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.a = 5

cols = st.columns(2)
minimum = cols[0].number_input("Min", 1, 5, key="min")
maximum = cols[1].number_input("Max", 6, 10, 10, key="max")


def update_value():
    # Helper function to ensure consistency between widget parameters and value
    st.session_state.a = min(st.session_state.a, maximum)
    st.session_state.a = max(st.session_state.a, minimum)


# Validate the slider value before rendering
update_value()
st.slider("A", minimum, maximum, key="a")


The update_value() helper function is actually doing two things. On the surface, it's making sure there are no inconsistent changes to the parameters values as described. Importantly, it's also interrupting the widget clean-up process. When the min or max value of the widget changes, Streamlit sees it as a new widget on rerun. Without saving a value to st.session_state.a, the value would be thrown out and replaced by the "new" widget's default value.

Understanding widget behavior

Widgets (like st.button, st.selectbox, and st.text_input) are at the heart of Streamlit apps. They are the interactive elements of Streamlit that pass information from your users into your Python code. Widgets are magical and often work how you want, but they can have surprising behavior in some situations. Understanding the different parts of a widget and the precise order in which events occur helps you achieve your desired results.

This guide covers advanced concepts about widgets. Generally, it begins with simpler concepts and increases in complexity. For most beginning users, these details won't be important to know right away. When you want to dynamically change widgets or preserve widget information between pages, these concepts will be important to understand. We recommend having a basic understanding of Session State before reading this guide.

üéà TL;DR
expand_more
Anatomy of a widget

There are four parts to keep in mind when using widgets:

The frontend component as seen by the user.
The backend value or value as seen through st.session_state.
The key of the widget used to access its value via st.session_state.
The return value given by the widget's function.
Widgets are session dependent

Widget states are dependent on a particular session (browser connection). The actions of one user do not affect the widgets of any other user. Furthermore, if a user opens up multiple tabs to access an app, each tab will be a unique session. Changing a widget in one tab will not affect the same widget in another tab.

Widgets return simple Python data types

The value of a widget as seen through st.session_state and returned by the widget function are of simple Python types. For example, st.button returns a boolean value and will have the same boolean value saved in st.session_state if using a key. The first time a widget function is called (before a user interacts with it), it will return its default value. (e.g. st.selectbox returns the first option by default.) Default values are configurable for all widgets with a few special exceptions like st.button and st.file_uploader.

Keys help distinguish widgets and access their values

Widget keys serve two purposes:

Distinguishing two otherwise identical widgets.
Creating a means to access and manipulate the widget's value through st.session_state.

Whenever possible, Streamlit updates widgets incrementally on the frontend instead of rebuilding them with each rerun. This means Streamlit assigns an ID to each widget from the arguments passed to the widget function. A widget's ID is based on parameters such as label, min or max value, default value, placeholder text, help text, and key. The page where the widget appears also factors into a widget's ID. If you have two widgets of the same type with the same arguments on the same page, you will get a DuplicateWidgetID error. In this case, assign unique keys to the two widgets.

Streamlit can't understand two identical widgets on the same page
# This will cause a DuplicateWidgetID error.
st.button("OK")
st.button("OK")

Use keys to distinguish otherwise identical widgets
st.button("OK", key="privacy")
st.button("OK", key="terms")

Order of operations

When a user interacts with a widget, the order of logic is:

Its value in st.session_state is updated.
The callback function (if any) is executed.
The page reruns with the widget function returning its new value.

If the callback function writes anything to the screen, that content will appear above the rest of the page. A callback function runs as a prefix to the script rerunning. Consequently, that means anything written via a callback function will disappear as soon as the user performs their next action. Other widgets should generally not be created within a callback function.

push_pin
Note

If a callback function is passed any args or kwargs, those arguments will be established when the widget is rendered. In particular, if you want to use a widget's new value in its own callback function, you cannot pass that value to the callback function via the args parameter; you will have to assign a key to the widget and look up its new value using a call to st.session_state within the callback function.

Using callback functions with forms

Using a callback function with a form requires consideration of this order of operations.

import streamlit as st

if "attendance" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.attendance = set()


def take_attendance():
    if st.session_state.name in st.session_state.attendance:
        st.info(f"{st.session_state.name} has already been counted.")
    else:
        st.session_state.attendance.add(st.session_state.name)


with st.form(key="my_form"):
    st.text_input("Name", key="name")
    st.form_submit_button("I'm here!", on_click=take_attendance)

Statefulness of widgets

As long as the defining parameters of a widget remain the same and that widget is continuously rendered on the frontend, then it will be stateful and remember user input.

Changing parameters of a widget will reset it

If any of the defining parameters of a widget change, Streamlit will see it as a new widget and it will reset. The use of manually assigned keys and default values is particularly important in this case. Note that callback functions, callback args and kwargs, label visibility, and disabling a widget do not affect a widget's identity.

In this example, we have a slider whose min and max values are changed. Try interacting with each slider to change its value then change the min or max setting to see what happens.

import streamlit as st

cols = st.columns([2, 1, 2])
minimum = cols[0].number_input("Minimum", 1, 5)
maximum = cols[2].number_input("Maximum", 6, 10, 10)

st.slider("No default, no key", minimum, maximum)
st.slider("No default, with key", minimum, maximum, key="a")
st.slider("With default, no key", minimum, maximum, value=5)
st.slider("With default, with key", minimum, maximum, value=5, key="b")

Updating a slider with no default value

For the first two sliders above, as soon as the min or max value is changed, the sliders reset to the min value. The changing of the min or max value makes them "new" widgets from Streamlit's perspective and so they are recreated from scratch when the app reruns with the changed parameters. Since no default value is defined, each widget will reset to its min value. This is the same with or without a key since it's seen as a new widget either way. There is a subtle point to understand about pre-existing keys connecting to widgets. This will be explained further down in Widget life cycle.

Updating a slider with a default value

For the last two sliders above, a change to the min or max value will result in the widgets being seen as "new" and thus recreated like before. Since a default value of 5 is defined, each widget will reset to 5 whenever the min or max is changed. This is again the same (with or without a key).

A solution to Retain statefulness when changing a widget's parameters is provided further on.

Widgets do not persist when not continually rendered

If a widget's function is not called during a script run, then none of its parts will be retained, including its value in st.session_state. If a widget has a key and you navigate away from that widget, its key and associated value in st.session_state will be deleted. Even temporarily hiding a widget will cause it to reset when it reappears; Streamlit will treat it like a new widget. You can either interrupt the Widget clean-up process (described at the end of this page) or save the value to another key.

Save widget values in Session State to preserve them between pages

If you want to navigate away from a widget and return to it while keeping its value, use a separate key in st.session_state to save the information independently from the widget. In this example, a temporary key is used with a widget. The temporary key uses an underscore prefix. Hence, _my_key is used as the widget key, but the data is copied to my_key to preserve it between pages.

import streamlit as st

def save_value():
    # Copy the value to the permanent key
    st.session_state["my_key"] = st.session_state["_my_key"]

# Copy the saved value to the temporary key
st.session_state["_my_key"] = st.session_state["my_key"]
st.number_input("Number of filters", key="_my_key", on_change=save_value)


If this is functionalized to work with multiple widgets, it could look something like this:

import streamlit as st

def save_value(key):
    st.session_state[key] = st.session_state["_"+key]
def get_value(key):
    st.session_state["_"+key] = st.session_state[key]

get_value("my_key")
st.number_input("Number of filters", key="_my_key", on_change=save_value, args="my_key")


Widget life cycle

When a widget function is called, Streamlit will check if it already has a widget with the same parameters. Streamlit will reconnect if it thinks the widget already exists. Otherwise, it will make a new one.

As mentioned earlier, Streamlit determines a widget's ID based on parameters such as label, min or max value, default value, placeholder text, help text, and key. The page name also factors into a widget's ID. On the other hand, callback functions, callback args and kwargs, label visibility, and disabling a widget do not affect a widget's identity.

Calling a widget function when the widget doesn't already exist

If your script rerun calls a widget function with changed parameters or calls a widget function that wasn't used on the last script run:

Streamlit will build the frontend and backend parts of the widget.
If the widget has been assigned a key, Streamlit will check if that key already exists in Session State.
a. If it exists and is not currently associated with another widget, Streamlit will attach to that key and take on its value for the widget.
b. Otherwise, it will assign the default value to the key in st.session_state (creating a new key-value pair or overwriting an existing one).
If there are args or kwargs for a callback function, they are computed and saved at this point in time.
The default value is then returned by the function.

Step 2 can be tricky. If you have a widget:

st.number_input("Alpha",key="A")


and you change it on a page rerun to:

st.number_input("Beta",key="A")


Streamlit will see that as a new widget because of the label change. The key "A" will be considered part of the widget labeled "Alpha" and will not be attached as-is to the new widget labeled "Beta". Streamlit will destroy st.session_state.A and recreate it with the default value.

def update_value():
    # Helper function to ensure consistency between widget parameters and value
    st.session_state.a = min(st.session_state.a, maximum)

Connect Streamlit to MySQL
Introduction

This guide explains how to securely access a remote MySQL database from Streamlit Community Cloud. It uses st.connection and Streamlit's Secrets management. The below example code will only work on Streamlit version >= 1.28, when st.connection was added.

Create a MySQL database
push_pin
Note

If you already have a database that you want to use, feel free to skip to the next step.

First, follow this tutorial to install MySQL and start the MySQL server (note down the username and password!). Once your MySQL server is up and running, connect to it with the mysql client and enter the following commands to create a database and a table with some example values:

CREATE DATABASE pets;

USE pets;

CREATE TABLE mytable (
    name            varchar(80),
    pet             varchar(80)
);

INSERT INTO mytable VALUES ('Mary', 'dog'), ('John', 'cat'), ('Robert', 'bird');

Add username and password to your local app secrets

Your local Streamlit app will read secrets from a file .streamlit/secrets.toml in your app's root directory. Learn more about Streamlit secrets management here. Create this file if it doesn't exist yet and add the database name, user, and password of your MySQL server as shown below:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml

[connections.mysql]
dialect = "mysql"
host = "localhost"
port = 3306
database = "xxx"
username = "xxx"
password = "xxx"

priority_high
Important

When copying your app secrets to Streamlit Community Cloud, be sure to replace the values of host, port, database, username, and password with those of your remote MySQL database!

Add this file to .gitignore and don't commit it to your GitHub repo!

Copy your app secrets to the cloud

As the secrets.toml file above is not committed to GitHub, you need to pass its content to your deployed app (on Streamlit Community Cloud) separately. Go to the app dashboard and in the app's dropdown menu, click on Edit Secrets. Copy the content of secrets.toml into the text area. More information is available at Secrets management.

Add dependencies to your requirements file

Add the mysqlclient and SQLAlchemy packages to your requirements.txt file, preferably pinning its version (replace x.x.x with the version you want installed):

# requirements.txt
mysqlclient==x.x.x
SQLAlchemy==x.x.x

Write your Streamlit app

Copy the code below to your Streamlit app and run it. Make sure to adapt query to use the name of your table.

# streamlit_app.py

import streamlit as st

# Initialize connection.
conn = st.connection('mysql', type='sql')

# Perform query.
df = conn.query('SELECT * from mytable;', ttl=600)

# Print results.
for row in df.itertuples():
    st.write(f"{row.name} has a :{row.pet}:")


See st.connection above? This handles secrets retrieval, setup, query caching and retries. By default, query() results are cached without expiring. In this case, we set ttl=600 to ensure the query result is cached for no longer than 10 minutes. You can also set ttl=0 to disable caching. Learn more in Caching.

If everything worked out (and you used the example table we created above), your app should look like this:

Using forms

When you don't want to rerun your script with each input made by a user, st.form is here to help! Forms make it easy to batch user input into a single rerun. This guide to using forms provides examples and explains how users interact with forms.

Example

In the following example, a user can set multiple parameters to update the map. As the user changes the parameters, the script will not rerun and the map will not update. When the user submits the form with the button labeled "Update map", the script reruns and the map updates.

If at any time the user clicks "Generate new points" which is outside of the form, the script will rerun. If the user has any unsubmitted changes within the form, these will not be sent with the rerun. All changes made to a form will only be sent to the Python backend when the form itself is submitted.

User interaction

If a widget is not in a form, that widget will trigger a script rerun whenever a user changes its value. For widgets with keyed input (st.number_input, st.text_input, st.text_area), a new value triggers a rerun when the user clicks or tabs out of the widget. A user can also submit a change by pressing Enter while thier cursor is active in the widget.

On the other hand if a widget is inside of a form, the script will not rerun when a user clicks or tabs out of that widget. For widgets inside a form, the script will rerun when the form is submitted and all widgets within the form will send their updated values to the Python backend.

A user can submit a form using Enter on their keyboard if their cursor active in a widget that accepts keyed input. Within st.number_input and st.text_input a user presses Enter to submit the form. Within st.text_area a user presses Ctrl+Enter/‚åò+Enter to submit the form.

Widget values

Before a form is submitted, all widgets within that form will have default values, just like widgets outside of a form have default values.

import streamlit as st

with st.form("my_form"):
   st.write("Inside the form")
   my_number = st.slider('Pick a number', 1, 10)
   my_color = st.selectbox('Pick a color', ['red','orange','green','blue','violet'])
   st.form_submit_button('Submit my picks')

# This is outside the form
st.write(my_number)
st.write(my_color)

Forms are containers

When st.form is called, a container is created on the frontend. You can write to that container like you do with other container elements. That is, you can use Python's with statement as shown in the example above, or you can assign the form container to a variable and call methods on it directly. Additionally, you can place st.form_submit_button anywhere in the form container.

import streamlit as st

animal = st.form('my_animal')

# This is writing directly to the main body. Since the form container is
# defined above, this will appear below everything written in the form.
sound = st.selectbox('Sounds like', ['meow','woof','squeak','tweet'])

# These methods called on the form container, so they appear inside the form.
submit = animal.form_submit_button(f'Say it with {sound}!')
sentence = animal.text_input('Your sentence:', 'Where\'s the tuna?')
say_it = sentence.rstrip('.,!?') + f', {sound}!'
if submit:
    animal.subheader(say_it)
else:
    animal.subheader('&nbsp;')

Processing form submissions

The purpose of a form is to override the default behavior of Streamlit which reruns a script as soon as the user makes a change. For widgets outside of a form, the logical flow is:

The user changes a widget's value on the frontend.
The widget's value in st.session_state and in the Python backend (server) is updated.
The script rerun begins.
If the widget has a callback, it is executed as a prefix to the page rerun.
When the updated widget's function is executed during the rerun, it outputs the new value.

For widgets inside a form, any changes made by a user (step 1) do not get passed to the Python backend (step 2) until the form is submitted. Furthermore, the only widget inside a form that can have a callback function is the st.form_submit_button. If you need to execute a process using newly submitted values, you have three major patterns for doing so.

Execute the process after the form

If you need to execute a one-time process as a result of a form submission, you can condition that process on the st.form_submit_button and execute it after the form. If you need results from your process to display above the form, you can use containers to control where the form displays relative to your output.

import streamlit as st

col1,col2 = st.columns([1,2])
col1.title('Sum:')

with st.form('addition'):
    a = st.number_input('a')
    b = st.number_input('b')
    submit = st.form_submit_button('add')

if submit:
    col2.title(f'{a+b:.2f}')

Use a callback with session state

You can use a callback to execute a process as a prefix to the script rerunning.

priority_high
Important

When processing newly updated values within a callback, do not pass those values to the callback directly through the args or kwargs parameters. You need to assign a key to any widget whose value you use within the callback. If you look up the value of that widget from st.session_state within the body of the callback, you will be able to access the newly submitted value. See the example below.

import streamlit as st

if 'sum' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.sum = ''

def sum():
    result = st.session_state.a + st.session_state.b
    st.session_state.sum = result

col1,col2 = st.columns(2)
col1.title('Sum:')
if isinstance(st.session_state.sum, float):
    col2.title(f'{st.session_state.sum:.2f}')

with st.form('addition'):
    st.number_input('a', key = 'a')
    st.number_input('b', key = 'b')
    st.form_submit_button('add', on_click=sum)

Use
st.rerun

If your process affects content above your form, another alternative is using an extra rerun. This can be less resource-efficient though, and may be less desirable that the above options.

import streamlit as st

if 'sum' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.sum = ''

col1,col2 = st.columns(2)
col1.title('Sum:')
if isinstance(st.session_state.sum, float):
    col2.title(f'{st.session_state.sum:.2f}')

with st.form('addition'):
    a = st.number_input('a')
    b = st.number_input('b')
    submit = st.form_submit_button('add')

# The value of st.session_state.sum is updated at the end of the script rerun,
# so the displayed value at the top in col2 does not show the new sum. Trigger
# a second rerun when the form is submitted to update the value above.
st.session_state.sum = a + b
if submit:
    st.rerun()

Limitations
Every form must contain a st.form_submit_button.
st.button and st.download_button cannot be added to a form.
st.form cannot be embedded inside another st.form.
Callback functions can only be assigned to st.form_submit_button within a form; no other widgets in a form can have a callback.
Interdependent widgets within a form are unlikely to be particularly useful. If you pass widget1's value into widget2 when they are both inside a form, then widget2 will only update when the form is submitted.

CONTENTS
Details on usage
Example usage
Static file serving

Streamlit apps can host and serve small, static media files to support media embedding use cases that won't work with the normal media elements.

To enable this feature, set enableStaticServing = true under [server] in your config file, or environment variable STREAMLIT_SERVER_ENABLE_STATIC_SERVING=true.

Media stored in the folder ./static/ relative to the running app file is served at path app/static/[filename], such as http://localhost:8501/app/static/cat.png.

Details on usage
Files with the following extensions will be served normally: ".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".gif". Any other file will be sent with header Content-Type:text/plain which will cause browsers to render in plain text. This is included for security - other file types that need to render should be hosted outside the app.
Streamlit also sets X-Content-Type-Options:nosniff for all files rendered from the static directory.
For apps running on Streamlit Community Cloud:
Files available in the Github repo will always be served. Any files generated while the app is running, such as based on user interaction (file upload, etc), are not guaranteed to persist across user sessions.
Apps which store and serve many files, or large files, may run into resource limits and be shut down.
Example usage
Put an image cat.png in the folder ./static/
Add enableStaticServing = true under [server] in your .streamlit/config.toml
Any media in the ./static/ folder is served at the relative URL like app/static/cat.png
# .streamlit/config.toml

[server]
enableStaticServing = true

# app.py
import streamlit as st

with st.echo():
    st.title("CAT")

    st.markdown("[![Click me](app/static/cat.png)](https://streamlit.io)")

Streamlit's native app testing framework

Streamlit app testing enables developers to build and run automated tests. Bring your favorite test automation software and enjoy simple syntax to simulate user input and inspect rendered output.

The provided class, AppTest, simulates a running app and provides methods to set up, manipulate, and inspect the app contents via API instead of a browser UI. AppTest provides similar functionality to browser automation tools like Selenium or Playwright, but with less overhead to write and execute tests. Use our testing framework with a tool like pytest to execute or automate your tests. A typical pattern is to build a suite of tests for an app to ensure consistent functionality as the app evolves. The tests run locally and/or in a CI environment like GitHub Actions.

Details on usage
Example usage
HTTPS support

Many apps need to be accessed with SSL / TLS protocol or https://.

We recommend performing SSL termination in a reverse proxy or load balancer for self-hosted and production use cases, not directly in the app. Streamlit Community Cloud uses this approach, and every major cloud and app hosting platform should allow you to configure it and provide extensive documentation. You can find some of these platforms in our Deployment tutorials.

To terminate SSL in your Streamlit app, you must configure server.sslCertFile and server.sslKeyFile. Learn how to set config options in Configuration.

Details on usage
The configuration value should be a local file path to a cert file and key file. These must be available at the time the app starts.
Both server.sslCertFile and server.sslKeyFile must be specified. If only one is specified, your app will exit with an error.
This feature will not work in Community Cloud. Community Cloud already serves your app with TLS.
priority_high
Warning

In a production environment, we recommend performing SSL termination by the load balancer or the reverse proxy, not using this option. The use of this option in Streamlit has not gone through extensive security audits or performance tests.

Example usage
# .streamlit/config.toml

[server]
sslCertFile = '/path/to/certchain.pem'
sslKeyFile = '/path/to/private.key'

Secrets management

Storing unencrypted secrets in a git repository is a bad practice. For applications that require access to sensitive credentials, the recommended solution is to store those credentials outside the repository - such as using a credentials file not committed to the repository or passing them as environment variables.

Streamlit provides native file-based secrets management to easily store and securely access your secrets in your Streamlit app.

push_pin
Note

Existing secrets management tools, such as dotenv files, AWS credentials files, Google Cloud Secret Manager, or Hashicorp Vault, will work fine in Streamlit. We just add native secrets management for times when it's useful.

How to use secrets management
Develop locally and set up secrets

Streamlit provides two ways to set up secrets locally using¬†TOML¬†format:

In a global secrets file at ~/.streamlit/secrets.toml for macOS/Linux or %userprofile%/.streamlit/secrets.toml for Windows:

# Everything in this section will be available as an environment variable
db_username = "Jane"
db_password = "mypassword"

# You can also add other sections if you like.
# The contents of sections as shown below will not become environment variables,
# but they'll be easily accessible from within Streamlit anyway as we show
# later in this doc.
[my_other_secrets]
things_i_like = ["Streamlit", "Python"]


If you use the global secrets file, you don't have to duplicate secrets across several project-level files if multiple Streamlit apps share the same secrets.

In a per-project secrets file at $CWD/.streamlit/secrets.toml, where $CWD is the folder you're running Streamlit from. If both a global secrets file and a per-project secrets file exist, secrets in the per-project file overwrite those defined in the global file.

priority_high
Important

Add this file to your .gitignore so you don't commit your secrets!

Use secrets in your app

Access your secrets by querying the¬†st.secrets¬†dict, or as environment variables. For example, if you enter the secrets from the section above, the code below shows you how to access them within your Streamlit app.

import streamlit as st

# Everything is accessible via the st.secrets dict:

st.write("DB username:", st.secrets["db_username"])
st.write("DB password:", st.secrets["db_password"])

# And the root-level secrets are also accessible as environment variables:

import os

st.write(
    "Has environment variables been set:",
    os.environ["db_username"] == st.secrets["db_username"],
)

star
Tip

You can access st.secrets via attribute notation (e.g. st.secrets.key), in addition to key notation (e.g. st.secrets["key"]) ‚Äî like st.session_state.

You can even compactly use TOML sections to pass multiple secrets as a single attribute. Consider the following secrets:

[db_credentials]
username = "my_username"
password = "my_password"


Rather than passing each secret as attributes in a function, you can more compactly pass the section to achieve the same result. See the notional code below, which uses the secrets above:

# Verbose version
my_db.connect(username=st.secrets.db_credentials.username, password=st.secrets.db_credentials.password)

# Far more compact version!
my_db.connect(**st.secrets.db_credentials)

Error handling

Here are some common errors you might encounter when using secrets management.

If a .streamlit/secrets.toml is created while the app is running, the server needs to be restarted for changes to be reflected in the app.

If you try accessing a secret, but no secrets.toml file exists, Streamlit will raise a FileNotFoundError exception:

If you try accessing a secret that doesn't exist, Streamlit will raise a KeyError exception:

import streamlit as st

st.write(st.secrets["nonexistent_key"])

Use secrets on Streamlit Community Cloud

When you deploy your app to Streamlit Community Cloud, you can use the same secrets management workflow as you would locally. However, you'll need to also set up your secrets in the Community Cloud Secrets Management console. Learn how to do so via the Cloud-specific Secrets management documentation.

Protect your secrets

Never save usernames, passwords, or security keys directly in your code or commit them to your repository.

Use environment variables

Avoid putting sensitve information in your code by using environment variables. Be sure to check out st.secrets. Research any platform you use to follow their security best practices. If you use Streamlit Community Cloud, Secrets management allows you save environment variables and store secrets outside of your code.

Keep
.gitignore
updated

If you use any sensitive or private information during development, make sure that information is saved in separate files from your code. Ensure .gitignore is properly configured to prevent saving private information to your repository.

Pickle warning

Streamlit's st.cache_data and st.session_state implicitly use the pickle module, which is known to be insecure. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data that will execute arbitrary code during unpickling. Never load data that could have come from an untrusted source in an unsafe mode or that could have been tampered with. Only load data you trust.

When using st.cache_data, anything your function returns is pickled and stored, then unpickled on retrieval. Ensure your cached functions return trusted values. This warning also applies to st.cache (deprecated).
When the runner.enforceSerializableSessionState configuration option is set to true, ensure all data saved and retrieved from Session State is trusted.

Connecting to data

Most Streamlit apps need some kind of data or API access to be useful - either retrieving data to view or saving the results of some user action. This data or API is often part of some remote service, database, or other data source.

Anything you can do with Python, including data connections, will generally work in Streamlit. Streamlit's tutorials are a great starting place for many data sources. However:

Connecting to data in a Python application is often tedious and annoying.
There are specific considerations for connecting to data from streamlit apps, such as caching and secrets management.

Streamlit provides st.connection() to more easily connect your Streamlit apps to data and APIs with just a few lines of code. This page provides a basic example of using the feature and then focuses on advanced usage.

For a comprehensive overview of this feature, check out this video tutorial by Joshua Carroll, Streamlit's Product Manager for Developer Experience. You'll learn about the feature's utility in creating and managing data connections within your apps by using real-world examples.

Basic usage

For basic startup and usage examples, read up on the relevant data source tutorial. Streamlit has built-in connections to SQL dialects and Snowflake. We also maintain installable connections for Cloud File Storage and Google Sheets.

If you are just starting, the best way to learn is to pick a data source you can access and get a minimal example working from one of the pages above üëÜ. Here, we will provide an ultra-minimal usage example for using a SQLite database. From there, the rest of this page will focus on advanced usage.

A simple starting point - using a local SQLite database

A local SQLite database could be useful for your app's semi-persistent data storage.

push_pin
Note

Community Cloud apps do not guarantee the persistence of local file storage, so the platform may delete data stored using this technique at any time.

To see the example below running live, check out the interactive demo below:

Step 1: Install prerequisite library - SQLAlchemy

All SQLConnections in Streamlit use SQLAlchemy. For most other SQL dialects, you also need to install the driver. But the SQLite driver ships with python3, so it isn't necessary.

pip install SQLAlchemy==1.4.0

Step 2: Set a database URL in your Streamlit secrets.toml file

Create a directory and file .streamlit/secrets.toml in the same directory your app will run from. Add the following to the file.

# .streamlit/secrets.toml

[connections.pets_db]
url = "sqlite:///pets.db"

Step 3: Use the connection in your app

The following app creates a connection to the database, uses it to create a table and insert some data, then queries the data back and displays it in a data frame.

# streamlit_app.py

import streamlit as st

# Create the SQL connection to pets_db as specified in your secrets file.
conn = st.connection('pets_db', type='sql')

# Insert some data with conn.session.
with conn.session as s:
    s.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS pet_owners (person TEXT, pet TEXT);')
    s.execute('DELETE FROM pet_owners;')
    pet_owners = {'jerry': 'fish', 'barbara': 'cat', 'alex': 'puppy'}
    for k in pet_owners:
        s.execute(
            'INSERT INTO pet_owners (person, pet) VALUES (:owner, :pet);',
            params=dict(owner=k, pet=pet_owners[k])
        )
    s.commit()

# Query and display the data you inserted
pet_owners = conn.query('select * from pet_owners')
st.dataframe(pet_owners)


In this example, we didn't set a ttl= value on the call to conn.query(), meaning Streamlit caches the result indefinitely as long as the app server runs.

Now, on to more advanced topics! üöÄ

Advanced topics
Global secrets, managing multiple apps and multiple data stores

Streamlit supports a global secrets file specified in the user's home directory, such as ~/.streamlit/secrets.toml. If you build or manage multiple apps, we recommend using a global credential or secret file for local development across apps. With this approach, you only need to set up and manage your credentials in one place, and connecting a new app to your existing data sources is effectively a one-liner. It also reduces the risk of accidentally checking in your credentials to git since they don't need to exist in the project repository.

For cases where you have multiple similar data sources that you connect to during local development (such as a local vs. staging database), you can define different connection sections in your secrets or credentials file for different environments and then decide which to use at runtime. st.connection supports this with the name=env:<MY_NAME_VARIABLE> syntax.

E.g., say I have a local and a staging MySQL database and want to connect my app to either at different times. I could create a global secrets file like this:

# ~/.streamlit/secrets.toml

[connections.local]
url = "mysql://me:****@localhost:3306/local_db"

[connections.staging]
url = "mysql://jdoe:******@staging.acmecorp.com:3306/staging_db"


Then I can configure my app connection to take its name from a specified environment variable

# streamlit_app.py
import streamlit as st

conn = st.connection("env:DB_CONN", "sql")
df = conn.query("select * from mytable")
# ...


Now I can specify whether to connect to local or staging at runtime by setting the DB_CONN environment variable.

# connect to local
DB_CONN=local streamlit run streamlit_app.py

# connect to staging
DB_CONN=staging streamlit run streamlit_app.py

Advanced SQLConnection configuration

The SQLConnection configuration uses SQLAlchemy create_engine() function. It will take a single URL argument or attempt to construct a URL from several parts (username, database, host, and so on) using SQLAlchemy.engine.URL.create().

Several popular SQLAlchemy dialects, such as Snowflake and Google BigQuery, can be configured using additional arguments to create_engine() besides the URL. These can be passed as **kwargs to the st.connection call directly or specified in an additional secrets section called create_engine_kwargs.

E.g. snowflake-sqlalchemy takes an additional connect_args argument as a dictionary for configuration that isn‚Äôt supported in the URL. These could be specified as follows:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml

[connections.snowflake]
url = "snowflake://<user_login_name>@<account_identifier>/"

[connections.snowflake.create_engine_kwargs.connect_args]
authenticator = "externalbrowser"
warehouse = "xxx"
role = "xxx"

# streamlit_app.py

import streamlit as st

# url and connect_args from secrets.toml above are picked up and used here
conn = st.connection("snowflake", "sql")
# ...


Alternatively, this could be specified entirely in **kwargs.

# streamlit_app.py

import streamlit as st

# secrets.toml is not needed
conn = st.connection(
    "snowflake",
    "sql",
    url = "snowflake://<user_login_name>@<account_identifier>/",
    connect_args = dict(
        authenticator = "externalbrowser",
        warehouse = "xxx",
        role = "xxx",
    )
)
# ...


You can also provide both kwargs and secrets.toml values, and they will be merged (typically, kwargs take precedence).

Connection considerations in frequently used or long-running apps

By default, connection objects are cached without expiration using st.cache_resource. In most cases this is desired. You can do st.connection('myconn', type=MyConnection, ttl=<N>) if you want the connection object to expire after some time.

Many connection types are expected to be long-running or completely stateless, so expiration is unnecessary. Suppose a connection becomes stale (such as a cached token expiring or a server-side connection being closed). In that case, every connection has a reset() method, which will invalidate the cached version and cause Streamlit to recreate the connection the next time it is retrieved

Convenience methods like query() and read() will typically cache results by default using st.cache_data without an expiration. When an app can run many different read operations with large results, it can cause high memory usage over time and results to become stale in a long-running app, the same as with any other usage of st.cache_data. For production use cases, we recommend setting an appropriate ttl on these read operations, such as conn.read('path/to/file', ttl="1d"). Refer to Caching for more information.

For apps that could get significant concurrent usage, ensure that you understand any thread safety implications of your connection, particularly when using a connection built by a third party. Connections built by Streamlit should provide thread-safe operations by default.

Build your own connection

Building your own basic connection implementation using an existing driver or SDK is quite straightforward in most cases. However, you can add more complex functionality with further effort. This custom implementation can be a great way to extend support to a new data source and contribute to the Streamlit ecosystem.

Maintaining a tailored internal Connection implementation across many apps can be a powerful practice for organizations with frequently used access patterns and data sources.

Check out the Build your own Connection page in the st.experimental connection demo app below for a quick tutorial and working implementation. This demo builds a minimal but very functional Connection on top of DuckDB.

The typical steps are:

Declare the Connection class, extending ExperimentalBaseConnection with the type parameter bound to the underlying connection object:

from streamlit.connections import ExperimentalBaseConnection
import duckdb

class DuckDBConnection(ExperimentalBaseConnection[duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection])


Implement the _connect method that reads any kwargs, external config/credential locations, and Streamlit secrets to initialize the underlying connection:

def _connect(self, **kwargs) -> duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection:
    if 'database' in kwargs:
        db = kwargs.pop('database')
    else:
        db = self._secrets['database']
    return duckdb.connect(database=db, **kwargs)


Add useful helper methods that make sense for your connection (wrapping them in st.cache_data where caching is desired)

Connection-building best practices

We recommend applying the following best practices to make your Connection consistent with the Connections built into Streamlit and the wider Streamlit ecosystem. These practices are especially important for Connections that you intend to distribute publicly.

Extend existing drivers or SDKs, and default to semantics that makes sense for their existing users.

You should rarely need to implement complex data access logic from scratch when building a Connection. Use existing popular Python drivers and clients whenever possible. Doing so makes your Connection easier to maintain, more secure, and enables users to get the latest features. E.g. SQLConnection extends SQLAlchemy, FileConnection extends fsspec, GsheetsConnection extends gspread, etc.

Consider using access patterns, method/argument naming, and return values that are consistent with the underlying package and familiar to existing users of that package.

Intuitive, easy to use read methods.

Much of the power of st.connection is providing intuitive, easy-to-use read methods that enable app developers to get started quickly. Most connections should expose at least one read method that is:

Named with a simple verb, like read(), query(), or get()
Wrapped by st.cache_data by default, with at least ttl= argument supported
If the result is in a tabular format, it returns a pandas DataFrame
Provides commonly used keyword arguments (such as paging or formatting) with sensible defaults - ideally, the common case requires only 1-2 arguments.

Config, secrets, and precedence in _connect method.

Every Connection should support commonly used connection parameters provided via Streamlit secrets and keyword arguments. The names should match the ones used when initializing or configuring the underlying package.

Additionally, where relevant, Connections should support data source specific configuration through existing standard environment variables or config / credential files. In many cases, the underlying package provides constructors or factory functions that already handle this easily.

When you can specify the same connection parameters in multiple places, we recommend using the following precedence order when possible (highest to lowest):

Keyword arguments specified in the code
Streamlit secrets
data source specific configuration (if relevant)

Handling thread safety and stale connections.

Connections should provide thread-safe operations when practical (which should be most of the time) and clearly document any considerations around this. Most underlying drivers or SDKs should provide thread-safe objects or methods - use these when possible.

If the underlying driver or SDK has a risk of stateful connection objects becoming stale or invalid, consider building a low impact health check or reset/retry pattern into the access methods. The SQLConnection built into Streamlit has a good example of this pattern using tenacity and the built-in Connection.reset() method. An alternate approach is to encourage developers to set an appropriate TTL on the st.connection() call to ensure it periodically reinitializes the connection object.

Experimental Features
The lifecycle of an experimental feature
Nightly releases
Pre-release features

At Streamlit, we like to move quick while keeping things stable. In our latest effort to move even faster without sacrificing stability, we're offering our bold and fearless users two ways to try out Streamlit's bleeding-edge features:

Experimental features
Nightly releases
Experimental Features

Less stable Streamlit features have one naming convention: st.experimental_. This distinction is a prefix we attach to our command names to make sure their status is clear to everyone.

Here's a quick rundown of what you get from each naming convention:

st: this is where our core features like st.write and st.dataframe live. If we ever make backward-incompatible changes to these, they will take place gradually and with months of announcements and warnings.
experimental: this is where we'll put all new features that may or may not ever make it into Streamlit core. This gives you a chance to try the next big thing we're cooking up weeks or months before we're ready to stabilize its API. We don't know whether these features have a future, but we want you to have access to everything we're trying, and work with us to figure them out.

Features with the experimental_ naming convention are things that we're still working on or trying to understand. If these features are successful, at some point they'll become part of Streamlit core. If unsuccessful, these features are removed without much notice. While in experimental, a feature's API and behaviors may not be stable, and it's possible they could change in ways that aren't backward-compatible.

priority_high
Warning

Experimental features and their APIs may change or be removed at any time.

The lifecycle of an experimental feature
A feature is added with the experimental_ prefix.
The feature is potentially tweaked over time, with possible API/behavior breakages.
If successful, we promote the feature to Streamlit core and remove it from experimental_:
a. The feature's API stabilizes and the feature is cloned without the experimental_ prefix, so it exists as both st and experimental_. At this point, users will see a warning when using the version of the feature with the experimental_ prefix -- but the feature will still work.
b. At some point, the code of the experimental_-prefixed feature is removed, but there will still be a stub of the function prefixed with experimental_ that shows an error with appropriate instructions.
c. Finally, at a later date the experimental_ version is removed.
If unsuccessful, the feature is removed without much notice and we leave a stub in experimental_ that shows an error with instructions.
Nightly releases

In addition to experimental features, we offer another way to try out Streamlit's newest features: nightly releases.

At the end of each day (at night üåõ), our bots run automated tests against the latest Streamlit code and, if everything looks good, it publishes them as the streamlit-nightly package. This means the nightly build includes all our latest features, bug fixes, and other enhancements on the same day they land on our codebase.

How does this differ from official releases?

Official Streamlit releases go not only through both automated tests but also rigorous manual testing, while nightly releases only have automated tests. It's important to keep in mind that new features introduced in nightly releases often lack polish. In our official releases, we always make double-sure all new features are ready for prime time.

How do I use the nightly release?

All you need to do is install the streamlit-nightly package:

pip uninstall streamlit
pip install streamlit-nightly --upgrade

priority_high
Warning

You should never have both streamlit and streamlit-nightly installed in the same environment!

Why should I use the nightly release?

Because you can't wait for official releases, and you want to help us find bugs early!

Why shouldn't I use the nightly release?

While our automated tests have high coverage, there's still a significant likelihood that there will be some bugs in the nightly code.

Can I choose which nightly release I want to install?

If you'd like to use a specific version, you can find the version number in our Release history. Specify the desired version using pip as usual: pip install streamlit-nightly==x.yy.zz-123456.

Can I compare changes between releases?

If you'd like to review the changes for a nightly release, you can use the comparison tool on GitHub.

How Streamlit handles timezones
datetime instance without a timezone (naive)
datetime instance with a timezone
Working with timezones

In general, working with timezones can be tricky. Your Streamlit app users are not necessarily in the same timezone as the server running your app. It is especially true of public apps, where anyone in the world (in any timezone) can access your app. As such, it is crucial to understand how Streamlit handles timezones, so you can avoid unexpected behavior when displaying datetime information.

How Streamlit handles timezones

Streamlit always shows datetime information on the frontend with the same information as its corresponding datetime instance in the backend. I.e., date or time information does not automatically adjust to the users' timezone. We distinguish between the following two cases:

datetime instance without a timezone (naive)

When you provide a datetime instance without specifying a timezone, the frontend shows the datetime instance without timezone information. For example (this also applies to other widgets like st.dataframe):

import streamlit as st
from datetime import datetime

st.write(datetime(2020, 1, 10, 10, 30))
# Outputs: 2020-01-10 10:30:00


Users of the above app always see the output as 2020-01-10 10:30:00.

datetime instance with a timezone

When you provide a datetime instance and specify a timezone, the frontend shows the datetime instance in that same timezone. For example (this also applies to other widgets like st.dataframe):

import streamlit as st
from datetime import datetime
import pytz

st.write(datetime(2020, 1, 10, 10, 30, tzinfo=pytz.timezone("EST")))
# Outputs: 2020-01-10 10:30:00-05:00


Users of the above app always see the output as 2020-01-10 10:30:00-05:00.

In both cases, neither the date nor time information automatically adjusts to the users' timezone on the frontend. What users see is identical to the corresponding datetime instance in the backend. It is currently not possible to automatically adjust the date or time information to the timezone of the users viewing the app.

push_pin
Note

The legacy version of the st.dataframe has issues with timezones. We do not plan to roll out additional fixes or enhancements for the legacy dataframe. If you need stable timezone support, please consider switching to the arrow serialization by changing the config setting, config.dataFrameSerialization = "arrow".

Add statefulness to apps
What is State?

We define access to a Streamlit app in a browser tab as a session. For each browser tab that connects to the Streamlit server, a new session is created. Streamlit reruns your script from top to bottom every time you interact with your app. Each reruns takes place in a blank slate: no variables are shared between runs.

Session State is a way to share variables between reruns, for each user session. In addition to the ability to store and persist state, Streamlit also exposes the ability to manipulate state using Callbacks. Session state also persists across apps inside a multipage app.

In this guide, we will illustrate the usage of Session State and Callbacks as we build a stateful Counter app.

For details on the Session State and Callbacks API, please refer to our Session State API Reference Guide.

Also, check out this Session State basics tutorial video by Streamlit Developer Advocate Dr. Marisa Smith to get started:

Build a Counter

Let's call our script counter.py. It initializes a count variable and has a button to increment the value stored in the count variable:

import streamlit as st

st.title('Counter Example')
count = 0

increment = st.button('Increment')
if increment:
    count += 1

st.write('Count = ', count)


No matter how many times we press the Increment button in the above app, the count remains at 1. Let's understand why:

Each time we press the Increment button, Streamlit reruns counter.py from top to bottom, and with every run, count gets initialized to 0 .
Pressing Increment subsequently adds 1 to 0, thus count=1 no matter how many times we press Increment.

As we'll see later, we can avoid this issue by storing count as a Session State variable. By doing so, we're indicating to Streamlit that it should maintain the value stored inside a Session State variable across app reruns.

Let's learn more about the API to use Session State.

Initialization

The Session State API follows a field-based API, which is very similar to Python dictionaries:

import streamlit as st

# Check if 'key' already exists in session_state
# If not, then initialize it
if 'key' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['key'] = 'value'

# Session State also supports the attribute based syntax
if 'key' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.key = 'value'

Reads and updates

Read the value of an item in Session State by passing the item to st.write :

import streamlit as st

if 'key' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['key'] = 'value'

# Reads
st.write(st.session_state.key)

# Outputs: value


Update an item in Session State by assigning it a value:

import streamlit as st

if 'key' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['key'] = 'value'

# Updates
st.session_state.key = 'value2'     # Attribute API
st.session_state['key'] = 'value2'  # Dictionary like API


Streamlit throws an exception if an uninitialized variable is accessed:

import streamlit as st

st.write(st.session_state['value'])

# Throws an exception!


Let's now take a look at a few examples that illustrate how to add Session State to our Counter app.

Example 1: Add Session State

Now that we've got a hang of the Session State API, let's update our Counter app to use Session State:

import streamlit as st

st.title('Counter Example')
if 'count' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.count = 0

increment = st.button('Increment')
if increment:
    st.session_state.count += 1

st.write('Count = ', st.session_state.count)


As you can see in the above example, pressing the Increment button updates the count each time.

Example 2: Session State and Callbacks

Now that we've built a basic Counter app using Session State, let's move on to something a little more complex. The next example uses Callbacks with Session State.

Callbacks: A callback is a Python function which gets called when an input widget changes. Callbacks can be used with widgets using the parameters on_change (or on_click), args, and kwargs. The full Callbacks API can be found in our Session State API Reference Guide.

import streamlit as st

st.title('Counter Example using Callbacks')
if 'count' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.count = 0

def increment_counter():
    st.session_state.count += 1

st.button('Increment', on_click=increment_counter)

st.write('Count = ', st.session_state.count)


Now, pressing the Increment button updates the count each time by calling the increment_counter() function.

Example 3: Use args and kwargs in Callbacks

Callbacks also support passing arguments using the args parameter in a widget:

import streamlit as st

st.title('Counter Example using Callbacks with args')
if 'count' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.count = 0

increment_value = st.number_input('Enter a value', value=0, step=1)

def increment_counter(increment_value):
    st.session_state.count += increment_value

increment = st.button('Increment', on_click=increment_counter,
    args=(increment_value, ))

st.write('Count = ', st.session_state.count)


Additionally, we can also use the kwargs parameter in a widget to pass named arguments to the callback function as shown below:

import streamlit as st

st.title('Counter Example using Callbacks with kwargs')
if 'count' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.count = 0

def increment_counter(increment_value=0):
    st.session_state.count += increment_value

def decrement_counter(decrement_value=0):
    st.session_state.count -= decrement_value

st.button('Increment', on_click=increment_counter,
	kwargs=dict(increment_value=5))

st.button('Decrement', on_click=decrement_counter,
	kwargs=dict(decrement_value=1))

st.write('Count = ', st.session_state.count)

Example 4: Forms and Callbacks

Say we now want to not only increment the count, but also store when it was last updated. We illustrate doing this using Callbacks and st.form:

import streamlit as st
import datetime

st.title('Counter Example')
if 'count' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.count = 0
    st.session_state.last_updated = datetime.time(0,0)

def update_counter():
    st.session_state.count += st.session_state.increment_value
    st.session_state.last_updated = st.session_state.update_time

with st.form(key='my_form'):
    st.time_input(label='Enter the time', value=datetime.datetime.now().time(), key='update_time')
    st.number_input('Enter a value', value=0, step=1, key='increment_value')
    submit = st.form_submit_button(label='Update', on_click=update_counter)

st.write('Current Count = ', st.session_state.count)
st.write('Last Updated = ', st.session_state.last_updated)

Advanced concepts
Session State and Widget State association

Session State provides the functionality to store variables across reruns. Widget state (i.e. the value of a widget) is also stored in a session.

For simplicity, we have unified this information in one place. i.e. the Session State. This convenience feature makes it super easy to read or write to the widget's state anywhere in the app's code. Session State variables mirror the widget value using the key argument.

We illustrate this with the following example. Let's say we have an app with a slider to represent temperature in Celsius. We can set and get the value of the temperature widget by using the Session State API, as follows:

import streamlit as st

if "celsius" not in st.session_state:
    # set the initial default value of the slider widget
    st.session_state.celsius = 50.0

st.slider(
    "Temperature in Celsius",
    min_value=-100.0,
    max_value=100.0,
    key="celsius"
)

# This will get the value of the slider widget
st.write(st.session_state.celsius)


There is a limitation to setting widget values using the Session State API.

priority_high
Important

Streamlit does not allow setting widget values via the Session State API for st.button and st.file_uploader.

The following example will raise a StreamlitAPIException on trying to set the state of st.button via the Session State API:

import streamlit as st

if 'my_button' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.my_button = True
    # Streamlit will raise an Exception on trying to set the state of button

st.button('Submit', key='my_button')

Serializable Session State

Serialization refers to the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be persisted and shared, and allowing you to recover the data‚Äôs original structure. Python‚Äôs built-in pickle module serializes Python objects to a byte stream ("pickling") and deserializes the stream into an object ("unpickling").

By default, Streamlit‚Äôs Session State allows you to persist any Python object for the duration of the session, irrespective of the object‚Äôs pickle-serializability. This property lets you store Python primitives such as integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers and booleans, dataframes, and even lambdas returned by functions. However, some execution environments may require serializing all data in Session State, so it may be useful to detect incompatibility during development, or when the execution environment will stop supporting it in the future.

To that end, Streamlit provides a runner.enforceSerializableSessionState configuration option that, when set to true, only allows pickle-serializable objects in Session State. To enable the option, either create a global or project config file with the following or use it as a command-line flag:

# .streamlit/config.toml
[runner]
enforceSerializableSessionState = true


By "pickle-serializable", we mean calling pickle.dumps(obj) should not raise a PicklingError exception. When the config option is enabled, adding unserializable data to session state should result in an exception. E.g.,

import streamlit as st

def unserializable_data():
		return lambda x: x

#üëá results in an exception when enforceSerializableSessionState is on
st.session_state.unserializable = unserializable_data()

priority_high
Warning

When runner.enforceSerializableSessionState is set to true, Session State implicitly uses the pickle module, which is known to be insecure. Ensure all data saved and retrieved from Session State is trusted because it is possible to construct malicious pickle data that will execute arbitrary code during unpickling. Never load data that could have come from an untrusted source in an unsafe mode or that could have been tampered with. Only load data you trust.

Caveats and limitations

Here are some limitations to keep in mind when using Session State:

Session State exists for as long as the tab is open and connected to the Streamlit server. As soon as you close the tab, everything stored in Session State is lost.
Session State is not persisted. If the Streamlit server crashes, then everything stored in Session State gets wiped
For caveats and limitations with the Session State API, please see the API limitations.

Multipage apps

As apps grow large, it becomes useful to organize them into multiple pages. This makes the app easier to manage as a developer and easier to navigate as a user. Streamlit provides a frictionless way to create multipage apps. Pages are automatically shown in a nice navigation widget inside the app sidebar, and clicking on a page will navigate to the page without reloading the frontend ‚Äî making app browsing incredibly fast! In this guide, let‚Äôs learn how to create multipage apps.

Structuring multipage apps

Let's understand what it takes to create multipage apps ‚Äî including how to define pages, structure and run multipage apps, and navigate between pages in the user interface. Once you've understood the basics, you can jump right into a tutorial to Create a multipage app.

Run a multipage app

Running a multipage app is identical to running a single-page app. The command to run a multipage app is:

streamlit run [entrypoint file]


The "entrypoint file" is the first page the app will show to the user. Once you have added pages to your app, the entrypoint file appears as the top-most page in the sidebar. You can think of the entrypoint file as your app's "main page". For example, say your entrypoint file is Home.py. Then, to run your app, you can run streamlit run Home.py. This will start your app and execute the code in Home.py.

Adding pages

Once you've created your entrypoint file, you can add pages by creating .py files in a pages/ directory relative to your entrypoint file. For example, if your entrypoint file is Home.py, then you can create a pages/About.py file to define the "About" page. Here's a valid directory structure for a multipage app:

Home.py # This is the file you run with "streamlit run"
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ About.py # This is a page
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ 2_Page_two.py # This is another page
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ 3_üòé_three.py # So is this

star
Tip

When adding emojis to filenames, it‚Äôs best practice to include a numbered-prefix to make autocompletion in your terminal easier. Terminal-autocomplete can get confused by unicode (which is how emojis are represented).

Pages are defined as .py files in a pages/ directory. The filenames of pages are transformed to page names in the sidebar based on the the rules in the section below. For example, the About.py file will appear as "About" in the sidebar, 2_Page_two.py appears as "Page two", and 3_üòé_three.py appears as ‚Äúüòé¬†three":

Only .py files in the pages/ directory will be loaded as pages. Streamlit ignores all other files in the pages/ directory and subdirectories.

How pages are labeled and sorted in the UI

Page labels in the sidebar UI are generated from filenames. They may differ from the page title set in st.set_page_config. Let's learn what constitutes a valid filename for a page, how pages are displayed in the sidebar, and how pages are sorted.

Valid filenames for pages

Filenames are composed of four different parts:

A number ‚Äî if the file is prefixed with a number.
A separator ‚Äî could be _, -, space, or any combination thereof.
A label ‚Äî which is everything up to, but not including, .py.
The extension ‚Äî which is always .py.
How pages are displayed in the sidebar

What is displayed in the sidebar is the label part of the filename:

If there's no label, Streamlit uses the number as the label.
In the UI, Streamlit beautifies the label by replacing _ with space.
How pages are sorted in the sidebar

Sorting considers numbers in the filename to be actual numbers (integers):

Files that have a number appear before files without a number.
Files are sorted based on the number (if any), followed by the title (if any).
When files are sorted, Streamlit treats the number as an actual number rather than a string. So 03 is the same as 3.

This table shows examples of filenames and their corresponding labels, sorted by the order in which they appear in the sidebar.

Examples:

Filename	Rendered label
1 - first page.py	first page
12 monkeys.py	monkeys
123.py	123
123_hello_dear_world.py	hello dear world
_12 monkeys.py	12 monkeys
star
Tip

Emojis can be used to make your page names more fun! For example, a file named üè†_Home.py will create a page titled "üè† Home" in the sidebar.

Navigating between pages

Pages are automatically shown in a nice navigation UI inside the app's sidebar. When you click on a page in the sidebar UI, Streamlit navigates to that page without reloading the entire frontend ‚Äî making app browsing incredibly fast!

You can also navigate between pages using URLs. Pages have their own URLs, defined by the file's label. When multiple files have the same label, Streamlit picks the first one (based on the ordering described above). Users can view a specific page by visiting the page's URL.

If a user tries to access a URL for a page that does not exist, they will see a modal like the one below, saying the user has requested a page that was not found in the app‚Äôs pages/ directory.

Notes

Pages support magic commands.

Pages support run-on-save. Additionally, when you save a page, this causes a rerun for users currently viewing that exact page.

Adding or deleting a page causes the UI to update immediately.

Updating pages in the sidebar does not rerun the script.

st.set_page_config works at the page level. When you set a title or favicon using st.set_page_config, this applies to the current page only.

Pages share the same Python modules globally:

# page1.py
import foo
foo.hello = 123

# page2.py
import foo
st.write(foo.hello)  # If page1 already executed, this should write 123


Pages share the same st.session_state:

# page1.py
import streamlit as st
if "shared" not in st.session_state:
   st.session_state["shared"] = True

# page2.py
import streamlit as st
st.write(st.session_state["shared"])
# If page1 already executed, this should write True


You now have a solid understanding of multipage apps. You've learned how to structure apps, define pages, and navigate between pages in the user interface. It's time to create your first multipage app! ü•≥

Theming

In this guide, we provide examples of how Streamlit page elements are affected by the various theme config options. For a more high-level overview of Streamlit themes, see the Themes section of the main concepts documentation.

Streamlit themes are defined using regular config options: a theme can be set via command line flag when starting your app using streamlit run or by defining it in the [theme] section of a .streamlit/config.toml file. For more information on setting config options, please refer to the Streamlit configuration documentation.

The following config options show the default Streamlit Light theme recreated in the [theme] section of a .streamlit/config.toml file.

[theme]
primaryColor="#F63366"
backgroundColor="#FFFFFF"
secondaryBackgroundColor="#F0F2F6"
textColor="#262730"
font="sans serif"


Let's go through each of these options, providing screenshots to demonstrate what parts of a Streamlit app they affect where needed.

primaryColor

primaryColor defines the accent color most often used throughout a Streamlit app. A few examples of Streamlit widgets that use primaryColor include st.checkbox, st.slider, and st.text_input (when focused).

star
Tip

Any CSS color can be used as the value for primaryColor and the other color options below. This means that theme colors can be specified in hex or with browser-supported color names like "green", "yellow", and "chartreuse". They can even be defined in the RGB and HSL formats!

backgroundColor

Defines the background color used in the main content area of your app.

secondaryBackgroundColor

This color is used where a second background color is needed for added contrast. Most notably, it is the sidebar's background color. It is also used as the background color for most interactive widgets.

textColor

This option controls the text color for most of your Streamlit app.

font

Selects the font used in your Streamlit app. Valid values are "sans serif", "serif", and "monospace". This option defaults to "sans serif" if unset or invalid.

Note that code blocks are always rendered using the monospace font regardless of the font selected here.

base

An easy way to define custom themes that make small changes to one of the preset Streamlit themes is to use the base option. Using base, the Streamlit Light theme can be recreated as a custom theme by writing the following:

[theme]
base="light"


The base option allows you to specify a preset Streamlit theme that your custom theme inherits from. Any theme config options not defined in your theme settings have their values set to those of the base theme. Valid values for base are "light" and "dark".

For example, the following theme config defines a custom theme nearly identical to the Streamlit Dark theme, but with a new primaryColor.

[theme]
base="dark"
primaryColor="purple"


If base itself is omitted, it defaults to "light", so you can define a custom theme that changes the font of the Streamlit Light theme to serif with the following config

[theme]
font="serif"

Caching

Streamlit runs your script from top to bottom at every user interaction or code change. This execution model makes development super easy. But it comes with two major challenges:

Long-running functions run again and again, which slows down your app.
Objects get recreated again and again, which makes it hard to persist them across reruns or sessions.

But don't worry! Streamlit lets you tackle both issues with its built-in caching mechanism. Caching stores the results of slow function calls, so they only need to run once. This makes your app much faster and helps with persisting objects across reruns.

Minimal example
Basic usage
Advanced usage
Migrating from st.cache
Minimal example

To cache a function in Streamlit, you must decorate it with one of two decorators (st.cache_data or st.cache_resource):

@st.cache_data
def long_running_function(param1, param2):
    return ‚Ä¶


In this example, decorating long_running_function with @st.cache_data tells Streamlit that whenever the function is called, it checks two things:

The values of the input parameters (in this case, param1 and param2).
The code inside the function.

If this is the first time Streamlit sees these parameter values and function code, it runs the function and stores the return value in a cache. The next time the function is called with the same parameters and code (e.g., when a user interacts with the app), Streamlit will skip executing the function altogether and return the cached value instead. During development, the cache updates automatically as the function code changes, ensuring that the latest changes are reflected in the cache.

As mentioned, there are two caching decorators:

st.cache_data¬†is the recommended way to cache computations that return data: loading a DataFrame from CSV, transforming a NumPy array, querying an API, or any other function that returns a serializable data object (str, int, float, DataFrame, array, list, ‚Ä¶). It creates a new copy of the data at each function call, making it safe against mutations and race conditions. The behavior of st.cache_data is what you want in most cases ‚Äì so if you're unsure, start with¬†st.cache_data¬†and see if it works!
st.cache_resource¬†is the recommended way to cache global resources like ML models or database connections ‚Äì unserializable objects that you don't want to load multiple times. Using it, you can share these resources across all reruns and sessions of an app without copying or duplication. Note that any mutations to the cached return value directly mutate the object in the cache (more details below).

Streamlit's two caching decorators and their use cases.

Basic usage
st.cache_data

st.cache_data is your go-to command for all functions that return data ‚Äì whether DataFrames, NumPy arrays, str, int, float, or other serializable types. It's the right command for almost all use cases!

Usage



Let's look at an example of using¬†st.cache_data. Suppose your app loads the Uber ride-sharing dataset ‚Äì a CSV file of 50 MB ‚Äì from the internet into a DataFrame:

def load_data(url):
    df = pd.read_csv(url)  # üëà Download the data
    return df

df = load_data("https://github.com/plotly/datasets/raw/master/uber-rides-data1.csv")
st.dataframe(df)

st.button("Rerun")


Running the load_data function takes 2 to 30 seconds, depending on your internet connection. (Tip: if you are on a slow connection, use this 5 MB dataset instead). Without caching, the download is rerun each time the app is loaded or with user interaction. Try it yourself by clicking the button we added! Not a great experience‚Ä¶ üòï

Now let's add the¬†@st.cache_data¬†decorator on load_data:

@st.cache_data  # üëà Add the caching decorator
def load_data(url):
    df = pd.read_csv(url)
    return df

df = load_data("https://github.com/plotly/datasets/raw/master/uber-rides-data1.csv")
st.dataframe(df)

st.button("Rerun")


Run the app again. You'll notice that the slow download only happens on the first run. Every subsequent rerun should be almost instant! üí®

Behavior



How does this work? Let's go through the behavior of st.cache_data step by step:

On the first run, Streamlit recognizes that it has never called the load_data function with the specified parameter value (the URL of the CSV file) So it runs the function and downloads the data.
Now our caching mechanism becomes active: the returned DataFrame is serialized (converted to bytes) via¬†pickle¬†and stored in the cache (together with the value of the url parameter).
On the next run, Streamlit checks the cache for an entry of load_data with the specific url. There is one! So it retrieves the cached object, deserializes it to a DataFrame, and returns it instead of re-running the function and downloading the data again.

This process of serializing and deserializing the cached object creates a copy of our original DataFrame. While this copying behavior may seem unnecessary, it's what we want when caching data objects since it effectively prevents mutation and concurrency issues. Read the section ‚ÄúMutation and concurrency issues" below to understand this in more detail.

priority_high
Warning

st.cache_data implicitly uses the pickle module, which is known to be insecure. Anything your cached function returns is pickled and stored, then unpickled on retrieval. Ensure your cached functions return trusted values because it is possible to construct malicious pickle data that will execute arbitrary code during unpickling. Never load data that could have come from an untrusted source in an unsafe mode or that could have been tampered with. Only load data you trust.

Examples



DataFrame transformations

In the example above, we already showed how to cache loading a DataFrame. It can also be useful to cache DataFrame transformations such as df.filter, df.apply, or df.sort_values. Especially with large DataFrames, these operations can be slow.

@st.cache_data
def transform(df):
    df = df.filter(items=['one', 'three'])
    df = df.apply(np.sum, axis=0)
	return df


Array computations

Similarly, it can make sense to cache computations on NumPy arrays:

@st.cache_data
def add(arr1, arr2):
	return arr1 + arr2


Database queries

You usually make SQL queries to load data into your app when working with databases. Repeatedly running these queries can be slow, cost money, and degrade the performance of your database. We strongly recommend caching any database queries in your app. See also our guides on connecting Streamlit to different databases for in-depth examples.

connection = database.connect()

@st.cache_data
def query():
    return pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * from table", connection)

star
Tip

You should set a ttl (time to live) to get new results from your database. If you set st.cache_data(ttl=3600), Streamlit invalidates any cached values after 1 hour (3600 seconds) and runs the cached function again. See details in Controlling cache size and duration.

API calls

Similarly, it makes sense to cache API calls. Doing so also avoids rate limits.

@st.cache_data
def api_call():
    response = requests.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')
    return response.json()


Running ML models (inference)

Running complex machine learning models can use significant time and memory. To avoid rerunning the same computations over and over, use caching.

@st.cache_data
def run_model(inputs):
    return model(inputs)

st.cache_resource

st.cache_resource is the right command to cache ‚Äúresources" that should be available globally across all users, sessions, and reruns. It has more limited use cases than st.cache_data, especially for caching database connections and ML models.

Usage

As an example for st.cache_resource, let's look at a typical machine learning app. As a first step, we need to load an ML model. We do this with Hugging Face's transformers library:

from transformers import pipeline
model = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")  # üëà Load the model


If we put this code into a Streamlit app directly, the app will load the model at each rerun or user interaction. Repeatedly loading the model poses two problems:

Loading the model takes time and slows down the app.
Each session loads the model from scratch, which takes up a huge amount of memory.

Instead, it would make much more sense to load the model once and use that same object across all users and sessions. That's exactly the use case for st.cache_resource! Let's add it to our app and process some text the user entered:

from transformers import pipeline

@st.cache_resource  # üëà Add the caching decorator
def load_model():
    return pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

model = load_model()

query = st.text_input("Your query", value="I love Streamlit! üéà")
if query:
    result = model(query)[0]  # üëà Classify the query text
    st.write(result)


If you run this app, you'll see that the app calls load_model only once ‚Äì right when the app starts. Subsequent runs will reuse that same model stored in the cache, saving time and memory!

Behavior



Using st.cache_resource is very similar to using st.cache_data. But there are a few important differences in behavior:

st.cache_resource does not create a copy of the cached return value but instead stores the object itself in the cache. All mutations on the function's return value directly affect the object in the cache, so you must ensure that mutations from multiple sessions do not cause problems. In short, the return value must be thread-safe.

priority_high
Warning

Using st.cache_resource on objects that are not thread-safe might lead to crashes or corrupted data. Learn more below under Mutation and concurrency issues.

Not creating a copy means there's just one global instance of the cached return object, which saves memory, e.g. when using a large ML model. In computer science terms, we create a singleton.

Return values of functions do not need to be serializable. This behavior is great for types not serializable by nature, e.g., database connections, file handles, or threads. Caching these objects with st.cache_data is not possible.

Examples



Database connections

st.cache_resource is useful for connecting to databases. Usually, you're creating a connection object that you want to reuse globally for every query. Creating a new connection object at each run would be inefficient and might lead to connection errors. That's exactly what st.cache_resource can do, e.g., for a Postgres database:

@st.cache_resource
def init_connection():
    host = "hh-pgsql-public.ebi.ac.uk"
    database = "pfmegrnargs"
    user = "reader"
    password = "NWDMCE5xdipIjRrp"
    return psycopg2.connect(host=host, database=database, user=user, password=password)

conn = init_connection()


Of course, you can do the same for any other database. Have a look at our guides on how to connect Streamlit to databases for in-depth examples.

Loading ML models

Your app should always cache ML models, so they are not loaded into memory again for every new session. See the example above for how this works with ü§ó¬†Hugging Face models. You can do the same thing for PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc. Here's an example for PyTorch:

@st.cache_resource
def load_model():
    model = torchvision.models.resnet50(weights=ResNet50_Weights.DEFAULT)
    model.eval()
    return model

model = load_model()

Deciding which caching decorator to use



The sections above showed many common examples for each caching decorator. But there are edge cases for which it's less trivial to decide which caching decorator to use. Eventually, it all comes down to the difference between ‚Äúdata" and ‚Äúresource":

Data are serializable objects (objects that can be converted to bytes via¬†pickle) that you could easily save to disk. Imagine all the types you would usually store in a database or on a file system ‚Äì basic types like str, int, and float, but also arrays, DataFrames, images, or combinations of these types (lists, tuples, dicts, and so on).
Resources are unserializable objects that you usually would not save to disk or a database. They are often more complex, non-permanent objects like database connections, ML models, file handles, threads, etc.

From the types listed above, it should be obvious that most objects in Python are ‚Äúdata." That's also why st.cache_data is the correct command for almost all use cases. st.cache_resource is a more exotic command that you should only use in specific situations.

Or if you're lazy and don't want to think too much, look up your use case or return type in the table below üòâ:

Use case	Typical return types	Caching decorator
Reading a CSV file with pd.read_csv	pandas.DataFrame	st.cache_data

Controlling cache size and duration

If your app runs for a long time and constantly caches functions, you might run into two problems:

The app runs out of memory because the cache is too large.
Objects in the cache become stale, e.g. because you cached old data from a database.

You can combat these problems with the ttl and max_entries parameters, which are available for both caching decorators.

The ttl (time-to-live) parameter

ttl sets a time to live on a cached function. If that time is up and you call the function again, the app will discard any old, cached values, and the function will be rerun. The newly computed value will then be stored in the cache. This behavior is useful for preventing stale data (problem 2) and the cache from growing too large (problem 1). Especially when pulling data from a database or API, you should always set a ttl so you are not using old data. Here's an example:

@st.cache_data(ttl=3600)  # üëà Cache data for 1 hour (=3600 seconds)
def get_api_data():
    data = api.get(...)
    return data

star
Tip

You can also set ttl values using timedelta, e.g., ttl=datetime.timedelta(hours=1).

The max_entries parameter

max_entries sets the maximum number of entries in the cache. An upper bound on the number of cache entries is useful for limiting memory (problem 1), especially when caching large objects. The oldest entry will be removed when a new entry is added to a full cache. Here's an example:

@st.cache_data(max_entries=1000)  # üëà Maximum 1000 entries in the cache
def get_large_array(seed):
    np.random.seed(seed)
    arr = np.random.rand(100000)
    return arr

Customizing the spinner

By default, Streamlit shows a small loading spinner in the app when a cached function is running. You can modify it easily with the show_spinner parameter, which is available for both caching decorators:

@st.cache_data(show_spinner=False)  # üëà Disable the spinner
def get_api_data():
    data = api.get(...)
    return data

@st.cache_data(show_spinner="Fetching data from API...")  # üëà Use custom text for spinner
def get_api_data():
    data = api.get(...)
    return data

Excluding input parameters

In a cached function, all input parameters must be hashable. Let's quickly explain why and what it means. When the function is called, Streamlit looks at its parameter values to determine if it was cached before. Therefore, it needs a reliable way to compare the parameter values across function calls. Trivial for a string or int ‚Äì but complex for arbitrary objects! Streamlit uses hashing to solve that. It converts the parameter to a stable key and stores that key. At the next function call, it hashes the parameter again and compares it with the stored hash key.

Unfortunately, not all parameters are hashable! E.g., you might pass an unhashable database connection or ML model to your cached function. In this case, you can exclude input parameters from caching. Simply prepend the parameter name with an underscore (e.g., _param1), and it will not be used for caching. Even if it changes, Streamlit will return a cached result if all the other parameters match up.

Here's an example:

@st.cache_data
def fetch_data(_db_connection, num_rows):  # üëà Don't hash _db_connection
    data = _db_connection.fetch(num_rows)
    return data

connection = init_connection()
fetch_data(connection, 10)


But what if you want to cache a function that takes an unhashable parameter? For example, you might want to cache a function that takes an ML model as input and returns the layer names of that model. Since the model is the only input parameter, you cannot exclude it from caching. In this case you can use the hash_funcs parameter to specify a custom hashing function for the model.

The
hash_funcs
parameter

As described above, Streamlit's caching decorators hash the input parameters and cached function's signature to determine whether the function has been run before and has a return value stored ("cache hit") or needs to be run ("cache miss"). Input parameters that are not hashable by Streamlit's hashing implementation can be ignored by prepending an underscore to their name. But there two rare cases where this is undesirable. i.e. where you want to hash the parameter that Streamlit is unable to hash:

When Streamlit's hashing mechanism fails to hash a parameter, resulting in a UnhashableParamError being raised.
When you want to override Streamlit's default hashing mechanism for a parameter.

Let's discuss each of these cases in turn with examples.

Example 1: Hashing a custom class

Streamlit does not know how to hash custom classes. If you pass a custom class to a cached function, Streamlit will raise a UnhashableParamError. For example, let's define a custom class MyCustomClass that accepts an initial integer score. Let's also define a cached function multiply_score that multiplies the score by a multiplier:

import streamlit as st

class MyCustomClass:
    def __init__(self, initial_score: int):
        self.my_score = initial_score

@st.cache_data
def multiply_score(obj: MyCustomClass, multiplier: int) -> int:
    return obj.my_score * multiplier

initial_score = st.number_input("Enter initial score", value=15)

score = MyCustomClass(initial_score)
multiplier = 2

st.write(multiply_score(score, multiplier))


If you run this app, you'll see that Streamlit raises a UnhashableParamError since it does not know how to hash MyCustomClass:

UnhashableParamError: Cannot hash argument 'obj' (of type __main__.MyCustomClass) in 'multiply_score'.


To fix this, we can use the hash_funcs parameter to tell Streamlit how to hash MyCustomClass. We do this by passing a dictionary to hash_funcs that maps the name of the parameter to a hash function. The choice of hash function is up to the developer. In this case, let's define a custom hash function hash_func that takes the custom class as input and returns the score. We want the score to be the unique identifier of the object, so we can use it to deterministically hash the object:

import streamlit as st

class MyCustomClass:
    def __init__(self, initial_score: int):
        self.my_score = initial_score

def hash_func(obj: MyCustomClass) -> int:
    return obj.my_score  # or any other value that uniquely identifies the object

@st.cache_data(hash_funcs={MyCustomClass: hash_func})
def multiply_score(obj: MyCustomClass, multiplier: int) -> int:
    return obj.my_score * multiplier

initial_score = st.number_input("Enter initial score", value=15)

score = MyCustomClass(initial_score)
multiplier = 2

st.write(multiply_score(score, multiplier))


Now if you run the app, you'll see that Streamlit no longer raises a UnhashableParamError and the app runs as expected.

Let's now consider the case where multiply_score is an attribute of MyCustomClass and we want to hash the entire object:

import streamlit as st

class MyCustomClass:
    def __init__(self, initial_score: int):
        self.my_score = initial_score

    @st.cache_data
    def multiply_score(self, multiplier: int) -> int:
        return self.my_score * multiplier

initial_score = st.number_input("Enter initial score", value=15)

score = MyCustomClass(initial_score)
multiplier = 2

st.write(score.multiply_score(multiplier))


If you run this app, you'll see that Streamlit raises a UnhashableParamError since it cannot hash the argument 'self' (of type __main__.MyCustomClass) in 'multiply_score'. A simple fix here could be to use Python's hash() function to hash the object:

import streamlit as st

class MyCustomClass:
    def __init__(self, initial_score: int):
        self.my_score = initial_score

    @st.cache_data(hash_funcs={"__main__.MyCustomClass": lambda x: hash(x.my_score)})
    def multiply_score(self, multiplier: int) -> int:
        return self.my_score * multiplier

initial_score = st.number_input("Enter initial score", value=15)

score = MyCustomClass(initial_score)
multiplier = 2

st.write(score.multiply_score(multiplier))


Above, the hash function is defined as lambda x: hash(x.my_score). This creates a hash based on the my_score attribute of the MyCustomClass instance. As long as my_score remains the same, the hash remains the same. Thus, the result of multiply_score can be retrieved from the cache without recomputation.

As an astute Pythonista, you may have been tempted to use Python's id() function to hash the object like so:

import streamlit as st

class MyCustomClass:
    def __init__(self, initial_score: int):
        self.my_score = initial_score

    @st.cache_data(hash_funcs={"__main__.MyCustomClass": id})
    def multiply_score(self, multiplier: int) -> int:
        return self.my_score * multiplier

initial_score = st.number_input("Enter initial score", value=15)

score = MyCustomClass(initial_score)
multiplier = 2

st.write(score.multiply_score(multiplier))


If you run the app, you'll notice that Streamlit recomputes multiply_score each time even if my_score hasn't changed! Puzzled? In Python, id() returns the identity of an object, which is unique and constant for the object during its lifetime. This means that even if the my_score value is the same between two instances of MyCustomClass, id() will return different values for these two instances, leading to different hash values. As a result, Streamlit considers these two different instances as needing separate cached values, thus it recomputes the multiply_score each time even if my_score hasn't changed.

This is why we discourage using it as hash func, and instead encourage functions that return deterministic, true hash values. That said, if you know what you're doing, you can use id() as a hash function. Just be aware of the consequences. For example, id is often the correct hash func when you're passing the result of an @st.cache_resource function as the input param to another cached function. There's a whole class of object types that aren‚Äôt otherwise hashable.

Example 2: Hashing a Pydantic model

Let's consider another example where we want to hash a Pydantic model:

import streamlit as st
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Person(BaseModel):
    name: str

@st.cache_data
def identity(person: Person):
    return person

person = identity(Person(name="Lee"))
st.write(f"The person is {person.name}")


Above, we define a custom class Person using Pydantic's BaseModel with a single attribute name. We also define an identity function which accepts an instance of Person as an arg and returns it without modification. This function is intended to cache the result, therefore, if called multiple times with the same Person instance, it won't recompute but return the cached instance.

If you run the app, however, you'll run into a UnhashableParamError: Cannot hash argument 'person' (of type __main__.Person) in 'identity'. error. This is because Streamlit does not know how to hash the Person class. To fix this, we can use the hash_funcs kwarg to tell Streamlit how to hash Person.

In the version below, we define a custom hash function hash_func that takes the Person instance as input and returns the name attribute. We want the name to be the unique identifier of the object, so we can use it to deterministically hash the object:

import streamlit as st
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Person(BaseModel):
    name: str

@st.cache_data(hash_funcs={Person: lambda p: p.name})
def identity(person: Person):
    return person

person = identity(Person(name="Lee"))
st.write(f"The person is {person.name}")

Example 3: Hashing a ML model

There may be cases where you want to pass your favorite machine learning model to a cached function. For example, let's say you want to pass a TensorFlow model to a cached function, based on what model the user selects in the app. You might try something like this:

import streamlit as st
import tensorflow as tf

@st.cache_resource
def load_base_model(option):
    if option == 1:
        return tf.keras.applications.ResNet50(include_top=False, weights="imagenet")
    else:
        return tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(include_top=False, weights="imagenet")

@st.cache_resource
def load_layers(base_model):
    return [layer.name for layer in base_model.layers]

option = st.radio("Model 1 or 2", [1, 2])

base_model = load_base_model(option)

layers = load_layers(base_model)

st.write(layers)


In the above app, the user can select one of two models. Based on the selection, the app loads the corresponding model and passes it to load_layers. This function then returns the names of the layers in the model. If you run the app, you'll see that Streamlit raises a UnhashableParamError since it cannot hash the argument 'base_model' (of type keras.engine.functional.Functional) in 'load_layers'.

If you disable hashing for base_model by prepending an underscore to its name, you'll observe that regardless of which base model is chosen, the layers displayed are same. This subtle bug is due to the fact that the load_layers function is not re-run when the base model changes. This is because Streamlit does not hash the base_model argument, so it does not know that the function needs to be re-run when the base model changes.

To fix this, we can use the hash_funcs kwarg to tell Streamlit how to hash the base_model argument. In the version below, we define a custom hash function hash_func: Functional: lambda x: x.name. Our choice of hash func is informed by our knowledge that the name attribute of a Functional object or model uniquely identifies it. As long as the name attribute remains the same, the hash remains the same. Thus, the result of load_layers can be retrieved from the cache without recomputation.

import streamlit as st
import tensorflow as tf
from keras.engine.functional import Functional

@st.cache_resource
def load_base_model(option):
    if option == 1:
        return tf.keras.applications.ResNet50(include_top=False, weights="imagenet")
    else:
        return tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(include_top=False, weights="imagenet")

@st.cache_resource(hash_funcs={Functional: lambda x: x.name})
def load_layers(base_model):
    return [layer.name for layer in base_model.layers]

option = st.radio("Model 1 or 2", [1, 2])

base_model = load_base_model(option)

layers = load_layers(base_model)

st.write(layers)


In the above case, we could also have used hash_funcs={Functional: id} as the hash function. This is because id is often the correct hash func when you're passing the result of an @st.cache_resource function as the input param to another cached function.

Example 4: Overriding Streamlit's default hashing mechanism

Let's consider another example where we want to override Streamlit's default hashing mechanism for a pytz-localized datetime object:

from datetime import datetime
import pytz
import streamlit as st

tz = pytz.timezone("Europe/Berlin")

@st.cache_data
def load_data(dt):
    return dt

now = datetime.now()
st.text(load_data(dt=now))

now_tz = tz.localize(datetime.now())
st.text(load_data(dt=now_tz))


It may be surprising to see that although now and now_tz are of the same <class 'datetime.datetime'> type, Streamlit does not how to hash now_tz and raises a UnhashableParamError. In this case, we can override Streamlit's default hashing mechanism for datetime objects by passing a custom hash function to the hash_funcs kwarg:

from datetime import datetime

import pytz
import streamlit as st

tz = pytz.timezone("Europe/Berlin")

@st.cache_data(hash_funcs={datetime: lambda x: x.strftime("%a %d %b %Y, %I:%M%p")})
def load_data(dt):
    return dt

now = datetime.now()
st.text(load_data(dt=now))

now_tz = tz.localize(datetime.now())
st.text(load_data(dt=now_tz))


Let's now consider a case where we want to override Streamlit's default hashing mechanism for NumPy arrays. While Streamlit natively hashes Pandas and NumPy objects, there may be cases where you want to override Streamlit's default hashing mechanism for these objects.

For example, let's say we create a cache-decorated show_data function that accepts a NumPy array and returns it without modification. In the bellow app, data = df["str"].unique() (which is a NumPy array) is passed to the show_data function.

import time
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

@st.cache_data
def get_data():
    df = pd.DataFrame({"num": [112, 112, 2, 3], "str": ["be", "a", "be", "c"]})
    return df

@st.cache_data
def show_data(data):
    time.sleep(2)  # This makes the function take 2s to run
    return data

df = get_data()
data = df["str"].unique()

st.dataframe(show_data(data))
st.button("Re-run")


Since data is always the same, we expect the show_data function to return the cached value. However, if you run the app, and click the Re-run button, you'll notice that the show_data function is re-run each time. We can assume this behavior is a consequence of Streamlit's default hashing mechanism for NumPy arrays.

To work around this, let's define a custom hash function hash_func that takes a NumPy array as input and returns a string representation of the array:

import time
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

@st.cache_data
def get_data():
    df = pd.DataFrame({"num": [112, 112, 2, 3], "str": ["be", "a", "be", "c"]})
    return df

@st.cache_data(hash_funcs={np.ndarray: str})
def show_data(data):
    time.sleep(2)  # This makes the function take 2s to run
    return data

df = get_data()
data = df["str"].unique()

st.dataframe(show_data(data))
st.button("Re-run")


Now if you run the app, and click the Re-run button, you'll notice that the show_data function is no longer re-run each time. It's important to note here that our choice of hash function was very naive and not necessarily the best choice. For example, if the NumPy array is large, converting it to a string representation may be expensive. In such cases, it is up to you as the developer to define what a good hash function is for your use case.

Static elements

Since version 1.16.0, cached functions can contain Streamlit commands! For example, you can do this:

@st.cache_data
def get_api_data():
    data = api.get(...)
    st.success("Fetched data from API!")  # üëà Show a success message
    return data


As we know, Streamlit only runs this function if it hasn't been cached before. On this first run, the st.success message will appear in the app. But what happens on subsequent runs? It still shows up! Streamlit realizes that there is an st. command inside the cached function, saves it during the first run, and replays it on subsequent runs. Replaying static elements works for both caching decorators.

You can also use this functionality to cache entire parts of your UI:

@st.cache_data
def show_data():
    st.header("Data analysis")
    data = api.get(...)
    st.success("Fetched data from API!")
    st.write("Here is a plot of the data:")
    st.line_chart(data)
    st.write("And here is the raw data:")
    st.dataframe(data)

Input widgets

You can also use interactive input widgets like st.slider or st.text_input in cached functions. Widget replay is an experimental feature at the moment. To enable it, you need to set the experimental_allow_widgets parameter:

@st.cache_data(experimental_allow_widgets=True)  # üëà Set the parameter
def get_data():
    num_rows = st.slider("Number of rows to get")  # üëà Add a slider
    data = api.get(..., num_rows)
    return data


Streamlit treats the slider like an additional input parameter to the cached function. If you change the slider position, Streamlit will see if it has already cached the function for this slider value. If yes, it will return the cached value. If not, it will rerun the function using the new slider value.

Using widgets in cached functions is extremely powerful because it lets you cache entire parts of your app. But it can be dangerous! Since Streamlit treats the widget value as an additional input parameter, it can easily lead to excessive memory usage. Imagine your cached function has five sliders and returns a 100 MB DataFrame. Then we'll add 100 MB to the cache for every permutation of these five slider values ‚Äì even if the sliders do not influence the returned data! These additions can make your cache explode very quickly. Please be aware of this limitation if you use widgets in cached functions. We recommend using this feature only for isolated parts of your UI where the widgets directly influence the cached return value.

priority_high
Warning

Support for widgets in cached functions is experimental. We may change or remove it anytime without warning. Please use it with care!

push_pin
Note

Two widgets are currently not supported in cached functions: st.file_uploader and st.camera_input. We may support them in the future. Feel free to open a GitHub issue if you need them!

Dealing with large data

As we explained, you should cache data objects with st.cache_data. But this can be slow for extremely large data, e.g., DataFrames or arrays with >100 million rows. That's because of the copying behavior of st.cache_data: on the first run, it serializes the return value to bytes and deserializes it on subsequent runs. Both operations take time.

If you're dealing with extremely large data, it can make sense to use st.cache_resource instead. It does not create a copy of the return value via serialization/deserialization and is almost instant. But watch out: any mutation to the function's return value (such as dropping a column from a DataFrame or setting a value in an array) directly manipulates the object in the cache. You must ensure this doesn't corrupt your data or lead to crashes. See the section on Mutation and concurrency issues below.

When benchmarking st.cache_data on pandas DataFrames with four columns, we found that it becomes slow when going beyond 100 million rows. The table shows runtimes for both caching decorators at different numbers of rows (all with four columns):

		10M rows	50M rows	100M rows	200M rows
st.cache_data	First run*	0.4 s	3 s	14 s	28 s
	Subsequent runs	0.2 s	1 s	2 s	7 s
st.cache_resource	First run*	0.01 s	0.1 s	0.2 s	1 s
	Subsequent runs	0 s	0 s	0 s	0 s

*For the first run, the table only shows the overhead time of using the caching decorator. It does not include the runtime of the cached function itself.
Mutation and concurrency issues

In the sections above, we talked a lot about issues when mutating return objects of cached functions. This topic is complicated! But it's central to understanding the behavior differences between st.cache_data and st.cache_resource. So let's dive in a bit deeper.

First, we should clearly define what we mean by mutations and concurrency:

By mutations, we mean any changes made to a cached function's return value after that function has been called. I.e. something like this:

@st.cache_data
def create_list():
    l = [1, 2, 3]

l = create_list()  # üëà Call the function
l[0] = 2  # üëà Mutate its return value


By concurrency, we mean that multiple sessions can cause these mutations at the same time. Streamlit is a web framework that needs to handle many users and sessions connecting to an app. If two people view an app at the same time, they will both cause the Python script to rerun, which may manipulate cached return objects at the same time ‚Äì concurrently.

Mutating cached return objects can be dangerous. It can lead to exceptions in your app and even corrupt your data (which can be worse than a crashed app!). Below, we'll first explain the copying behavior of st.cache_data and show how it can avoid mutation issues. Then, we'll show how concurrent mutations can lead to data corruption and how to prevent it.

Copying behavior

st.cache_data creates a copy of the cached return value each time the function is called. This avoids most mutations and concurrency issues. To understand it in detail, let's go back to the Uber ridesharing example from the section on st.cache_data above. We are making two modifications to it:

We are using st.cache_resource instead of st.cache_data. st.cache_resource does not create a copy of the cached object, so we can see what happens without the copying behavior.
After loading the data, we manipulate the returned DataFrame (in place!) by dropping the column "Lat".

Here's the code:

@st.cache_resource   # üëà Turn off copying behavior
def load_data(url):
    df = pd.read_csv(url)
    return df

df = load_data("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/uber-rides-data1.csv")
st.dataframe(df)

df.drop(columns=['Lat'], inplace=True)  # üëà Mutate the dataframe inplace

st.button("Rerun")


Let's run it and see what happens! The first run should work fine. But in the second run, you see an exception: KeyError: "['Lat'] not found in axis". Why is that happening? Let's go step by step:

On the first run, Streamlit runs load_data and stores the resulting DataFrame in the cache. Since we're using st.cache_resource, it does not create a copy but stores the original DataFrame.
Then we drop the column "Lat" from the DataFrame. Note that this is dropping the column from the original DataFrame stored in the cache. We are manipulating it!
On the second run, Streamlit returns that exact same manipulated DataFrame from the cache. It does not have the column "Lat" anymore! So our call to df.drop results in an exception. Pandas cannot drop a column that doesn't exist.

The copying behavior of st.cache_data prevents this kind of mutation error. Mutations can only affect a specific copy and not the underlying object in the cache. The next rerun will get its own, unmutated copy of the DataFrame. You can try it yourself, just replace st.cache_resource with st.cache_data above, and you'll see that everything works.

Because of this copying behavior,¬†st.cache_data¬†is the recommended way to cache data transforms and computations ‚Äì anything that returns a serializable object.

Concurrency issues

Now let's look at what can happen when multiple users concurrently mutate an object in the cache. Let's say you have a function that returns a list. Again, we are using st.cache_resource to cache it so that we are not creating a copy:

@st.cache_resource
def create_list():
    l = [1, 2, 3]
    return l

l = create_list()
first_list_value = l[0]
l[0] = first_list_value + 1

st.write("l[0] is:", l[0])


Let's say user A runs the app. They will see the following output:

l[0] is: 2


Let's say another user, B, visits the app right after. In contrast to user A, they will see the following output:

l[0] is: 3


Now, user A reruns the app immediately after user B. They will see the following output:

l[0] is: 4


What is happening here? Why are all outputs different?

When user A visits the app,¬†create_list()¬†is called, and the list¬†[1, 2, 3]¬†is stored in the cache. This list is then returned to user A. The first value of the list, 1, is assigned to first_list_value , and l[0]¬†is changed to 2.
When user B visits the app,¬†create_list()¬†returns the mutated list from the cache:¬†[2, 2, 3]. The first value of the list, 2, is assigned to first_list_value and l[0]¬†is changed to 3.
When user A reruns the app,¬†create_list()¬†returns the mutated list again:¬†[3, 2, 3]. The first value of the list, 3, is assigned to first_list_value, and l[0]¬†is changed to 4.

If you think about it, this makes sense. Users A and B use the same list object (the one stored in the cache). And since the list object is mutated, user A's change to the list object is also reflected in user B's app.

This is why you must be careful about mutating objects cached with st.cache_resource, especially when multiple users access the app concurrently. If we had used¬†st.cache_data¬†instead of¬†st.cache_resource, the app would have copied the list object for each user, and the above example would have worked as expected ‚Äì users A and B would have both seen:

l[0] is: 2

push_pin
Note

This toy example might seem benign. But data corruption can be extremely dangerous! Imagine we had worked with the financial records of a large bank here. You surely don't want to wake up with less money on your account just because someone used the wrong caching decorator üòâ

Migrating from st.cache

We introduced the caching commands described above in Streamlit 1.18.0. Before that, we had one catch-all command st.cache. Using it was often confusing, resulted in weird exceptions, and was slow. That's why we replaced st.cache with the new commands in 1.18.0 (read more in this blog post). The new commands provide a more intuitive and efficient way to cache your data and resources and are intended to replace st.cache in all new development.

If your app is still using st.cache, don't despair! Here are a few notes on migrating:

Streamlit will show a deprecation warning if your app uses st.cache.
We will not remove st.cache soon, so you don't need to worry about your 2-year-old app breaking. But we encourage you to try the new commands going forward ‚Äì they will be way less annoying!
Switching code to the new commands should be easy in most cases. To decide whether to use st.cache_data or st.cache_resource, read Deciding which caching decorator to use. Streamlit will also recognize common use cases and show hints right in the deprecation warnings.
Most parameters from st.cache are also present in the new commands, with a few exceptions:
allow_output_mutation does not exist anymore. You can safely delete it. Just make sure you use the right caching command for your use case.
suppress_st_warning does not exist anymore. You can safely delete it. Cached functions can now contain Streamlit commands and will replay them. If you want to use widgets inside cached functions, set experimental_allow_widgets=True. See Input widgets for an example.

If you have any questions or issues during the migration process, please contact us on the forum, and we will be happy to assist you. üéà

Button behavior and examples
Summary

Buttons created with st.button do not retain state. They return True on the script rerun resulting from their click and immediately return to False on the next script rerun. If a displayed element is nested inside if st.button('Click me'):, the element will be visible when the button is clicked and disappear as soon as the user takes their next action. This is because the script reruns and the button return value becomes False.

In this guide, we will illustrate the use of buttons and explain common misconceptions. Read on to see a variety of examples that expand on st.button using st.session_state. Anti-patterns are included at the end. Go ahead and pull up your favorite code editor so you can streamlit run the examples as you read. Check out Streamlit's Main concepts if you haven't run your own Streamlit scripts yet.

When to use
if st.button()

When code is conditioned on a button's value, it will execute once in response to the button being clicked and not again (until the button is clicked again).

Good to nest inside buttons:

Transient messages that immediately disappear.
Once-per-click processes that saves data to session state, a file, or a database.

Bad to nest inside buttons:

Displayed items that should persist as the user continues.
Other widgets which cause the script to rerun when used.
Processes that neither modify session state nor write to a file/database.*

* This can be appropriate when disposable results are desired. If you have a "Validate" button, that could be a process conditioned directly on a button. It could be used to create an alert to say 'Valid' or 'Invalid' with no need to keep that info.

Common logic with buttons
Show a temporary message with a button

If you want to give the user a quick button to check if an entry is valid, but not keep that check displayed as the user continues.

In this example, a user can click a button to check if their animal string is in the animal_shelter list. When the user clicks "Check availability" they will see "We have that animal!" or "We don't have that animal." If they change the animal in st.text_input, the script reruns and the message disappears until they click "Check availability" again.

import streamlit as st

animal_shelter = ['cat', 'dog', 'rabbit', 'bird']

animal = st.text_input('Type an animal')

if st.button('Check availability'):
    have_it = animal.lower() in animal_shelter
    'We have that animal!' if have_it else 'We don\'t have that animal.'


Note: The above example uses magic to render the message on the frontend.

Stateful button

If you want a clicked button to continue to be True, create a value in st.session_state and use the button to set that value to True in a callback.

import streamlit as st

if 'clicked' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.clicked = False

def click_button():
    st.session_state.clicked = True

st.button('Click me', on_click=click_button)

if st.session_state.clicked:
    # The message and nested widget will remain on the page
    st.write('Button clicked!')
    st.slider('Select a value')

Toggle button

If you want a button to work like a toggle switch, consider using st.checkbox. Otherwise, you can use a button with a callback function to reverse a boolean value saved in st.session_state.

In this example, we use st.button to toggle another widget on and off. By displaying st.slider conditionally on a value in st.session_state, the user can interact with the slider without it disappearing.

import streamlit as st

if 'button' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.button = False

def click_button():
    st.session_state.button = not st.session_state.button

st.button('Click me', on_click=click_button)

if st.session_state.button:
    # The message and nested widget will remain on the page
    st.write('Button is on!')
    st.slider('Select a value')
else:
    st.write('Button is off!')


Alternatively, you can use the value in st.session_state on the slider's disabled parameter.

import streamlit as st

if 'button' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.button = False

def click_button():
    st.session_state.button = not st.session_state.button

st.button('Click me', on_click=click_button)

st.slider('Select a value', disabled=st.session_state.button)

Buttons to continue or control stages of a process

Another alternative to nesting content inside a button is to use a value in st.session_state that designates the "step" or "stage" of a process. In this example, we have four stages in our script:

Before the user begins.
User enters their name.
User chooses a color.
User gets a thank-you message.

A button at the beginning advances the stage from 0 to 1. A button at the end resets the stage from 3 to 0. The other widgets used in stage 1 and 2 have callbacks to set the stage. If you have a process with dependant steps and want to keep previous stages visible, such a callback forces a user to retrace subsequent stages if they change an earlier widget.

import streamlit as st

if 'stage' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.stage = 0

def set_state(i):
    st.session_state.stage = i

if st.session_state.stage == 0:
    st.button('Begin', on_click=set_state, args=[1])

if st.session_state.stage >= 1:
    name = st.text_input('Name', on_change=set_state, args=[2])

if st.session_state.stage >= 2:
    st.write(f'Hello {name}!')
    color = st.selectbox(
        'Pick a Color',
        [None, 'red', 'orange', 'green', 'blue', 'violet'],
        on_change=set_state, args=[3]
    )
    if color is None:
        set_state(2)

if st.session_state.stage >= 3:
    st.write(f':{color}[Thank you!]')
    st.button('Start Over', on_click=set_state, args=[0])

Buttons to modify
st.session_state

If you modify st.session_state inside of a button, you must consider where that button is within the script.

A slight problem

In this example, we access st.session_state.name both before and after the buttons which modify it. When a button ("Jane" or "John") is clicked, the script reruns. The info displayed before the buttons lags behind the info written after the button. The data in st.session_state before the button is not updated. When the script executes the button function, that is when the conditional code to update st.session_state creates the change. Thus, this change is reflected after the button.

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

if 'name' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['name'] = 'John Doe'

st.header(st.session_state['name'])

if st.button('Jane'):
    st.session_state['name'] = 'Jane Doe'

if st.button('John'):
    st.session_state['name'] = 'John Doe'

st.header(st.session_state['name'])

Logic used in a callback

Callbacks are a clean way to modify st.session_state. Callbacks are executed as a prefix to the script rerunning, so the position of the button relative to accessing data is not important.

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

if 'name' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['name'] = 'John Doe'

def change_name(name):
    st.session_state['name'] = name

st.header(st.session_state['name'])

st.button('Jane', on_click=change_name, args=['Jane Doe'])
st.button('John', on_click=change_name, args=['John Doe'])

st.header(st.session_state['name'])

Logic nested in a button with a rerun

Although callbacks are often preferred to avoid extra reruns, our first 'John Doe'/'Jane Doe' example can be modified by adding st.rerun instead. If you need to acces data in st.session_state before the button that modifies it, you can include st.rerun to rerun the script after the change has been committed. This means the script will rerun twice when a button is clicked.

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

if 'name' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['name'] = 'John Doe'

st.header(st.session_state['name'])

if st.button('Jane'):
    st.session_state['name'] = 'Jane Doe'
    st.rerun()

if st.button('John'):
    st.session_state['name'] = 'John Doe'
    st.rerun()

st.header(st.session_state['name'])

Buttons to modify or reset other widgets

When a button is used to modify or reset another widget, it is the same as the above examples to modify st.session_state. However, an extra consideration exists: you cannot modify a key-value pair in st.session_state if the widget with that key has already been rendered on the page for the current script run.

priority_high
Important

Don't do this!

import streamlit as st

st.text_input('Name', key='name')

# These buttons will error because their nested code changes
# a widget's state after that widget within the script.
if st.button('Clear name'):
    st.session_state.name = ''
if st.button('Streamlit!'):
    st.session_state.name = ('Streamlit')

Option 1: Use a key for the button and put the logic before the widget

If you assign a key to a button, you can condition code on a button's state by using its value in st.session_state. This means that logic depending on your button can be in your script before that button. In the following example, we use the .get() method on st.session_state because the keys for the buttons will not exist when the script runs for the first time. The .get() method will return False if it can't find the key. Otherwise, it will return the value of the key.

import streamlit as st

# Use the get method since the keys won't be in session_state
# on the first script run
if st.session_state.get('clear'):
    st.session_state['name'] = ''
if st.session_state.get('streamlit'):
    st.session_state['name'] = 'Streamlit'

st.text_input('Name', key='name')

st.button('Clear name', key='clear')
st.button('Streamlit!', key='streamlit')

Option 2: Use a callback
import streamlit as st

st.text_input('Name', key='name')

def set_name(name):
    st.session_state.name = name

st.button('Clear name', on_click=set_name, args=[''])
st.button('Streamlit!', on_click=set_name, args=['Streamlit'])

Option 3: Use containers

By using st.container you can have widgets appear in different orders in your script and frontend view (webpage).

import streamlit as st

begin = st.container()

if st.button('Clear name'):
    st.session_state.name = ''
if st.button('Streamlit!'):
    st.session_state.name = ('Streamlit')

# The widget is second in logic, but first in display
begin.text_input('Name', key='name')

Buttons to add other widgets dynamically

When dynamically adding widgets to the page, make sure to use an index to keep the keys unique and avoid a DuplicateWidgetID error. In this example, we define a function display_input_row which renders a row of widgets. That function accepts an index as a parameter. The widgets rendered by display_input_row use index within their keys so that dispaly_input_row can be executed multiple times on a single script rerun without repeating any widget keys.

import streamlit as st

def display_input_row(index):
    left, middle, right = st.columns(3)
    left.text_input('First', key=f'first_{index}')
    middle.text_input('Middle', key=f'middle_{index}')
    right.text_input('Last', key=f'last_{index}')

if 'rows' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['rows'] = 0

def increase_rows():
    st.session_state['rows'] += 1

st.button('Add person', on_click=increase_rows)

for i in range(st.session_state['rows']):
    display_input_row(i)

# Show the results
st.subheader('People')
for i in range(st.session_state['rows']):
    st.write(
        f'Person {i+1}:',
        st.session_state[f'first_{i}'],
        st.session_state[f'middle_{i}'],
        st.session_state[f'last_{i}']
    )

Buttons to handle expensive or file-writing processes

When you have expensive processes, set them to run upon clicking a button and save the results into st.session_state. This allows you to keep accessing the results of the process without re-executing it unnecessarily. This is especially helpful for processes that save to disk or write to a database. In this example, we have an expensive_process that depends on two parameters: option and add. Functionally, add changes the output, but option does not‚Äîoption is there to provide a parameter

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import time

def expensive_process(option, add):
    with st.spinner('Processing...'):
        time.sleep(5)
    df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6], 'C':[7, 8, 9]}) + add
    return (df, add)

cols = st.columns(2)
option = cols[0].selectbox('Select a number', options=['1', '2', '3'])
add = cols[1].number_input('Add a number', min_value=0, max_value=10)

if 'processed' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.processed = {}

# Process and save results
if st.button('Process'):
    result = expensive_process(option, add)
    st.session_state.processed[option] = result

if option in st.session_state.processed:
    st.write(f'Option {option} processed with add {add}')
    st.write(st.session_state.processed[option][0])


Astute observers may think, "This feels a little like caching." We are only saving results relative to one parameter, but the pattern could easily be expanded to save results relative to both parameters. In that sense, yes, it has some similarities to caching, but also some important differences. When you save results in st.session_state, the results are only available to the current user in their current session. If you use st.cache_data instead, the results are available to all users across all sessions. Furthermore, if you want to update a saved result, you have to clear all saved results for that function to do so.

Anti-patterns

Here are some simplified examples of how buttons can go wrong. Be on the lookout for these common mistakes.

Buttons nested inside buttons
import streamlit as st

if st.button('Button 1'):
    st.write('Button 1 was clicked')
    if st.button('Button 2'):
        # This will never be executed.
        st.write('Button 2 was clicked')

Other widgets nested inside buttons
import streamlit as st

if st.button('Sign up'):
    name = st.text_input('Name')

    if name:
        # This will never be executed.
        st.success(f'Welcome {name}')

Nesting a process inside a button without saving to session state
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

file = st.file_uploader("Upload a file", type="csv")

if st.button('Get data'):
    df = pd.read_csv(file)
    # This display will go away with the user's next action.
    st.write(df)

if st.button('Save'):
    # This will always error.
    df.to_csv('data.csv')

Configuration

Streamlit provides four different ways to set configuration options. This list is in reverse order of precedence, i.e. command line flags take precedence over environment variables when the same configuration option is provided multiple times.

push_pin
Note

If changes to .streamlit/config.toml are made while the app is running, the server needs to be restarted for changes to be reflected in the app.

In a global config file at ~/.streamlit/config.toml for macOS/Linux or %userprofile%/.streamlit/config.toml for Windows:

[server]
port = 80


In a per-project config file at $CWD/.streamlit/config.toml, where $CWD is the folder you're running Streamlit from.

Through STREAMLIT_* environment variables, such as:

export STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT=80
export STREAMLIT_SERVER_COOKIE_SECRET=dontforgottochangeme


As flags on the command line when running streamlit run:

streamlit run your_script.py --server.port 80

Telemetry

As mentioned during the installation process, Streamlit collects usage statistics. You can find out more by reading our Privacy Notice, but the high-level summary is that although we collect telemetry data we cannot see and do not store information contained in Streamlit apps.

If you'd like to opt out of usage statistics, add the following to your config file:

[browser]
gatherUsageStats = false

Theming

You can change the base colors of your app using the [theme] section of the configuration system. To learn more, see Theming.

Display help and other information for a given object.

Depending on the type of object that is passed in, this displays the object's name, type, value, signature, docstring, and member variables, methods ‚Äî as well as the values/docstring of members and methods.

Function signature
[source]

st.help(obj=)

Parameters

obj (any)

The object whose information should be displayed. If left unspecified, this call will display help for Streamlit itself.

Example

Don't remember how to initialize a dataframe? Try this:

import streamlit as st
import pandas

st.help(pandas.DataFrame)
Copy

Want to quickly check what data type is output by a certain function? Try:

import streamlit as st

x = my_poorly_documented_function()
st.help(x)
Copy

Want to quickly inspect an object? No sweat:

class Dog:
  '''A typical dog.'''

  def __init__(self, breed, color):
    self.breed = breed
    self.color = color

  def bark(self):
    return 'Woof!'


fido = Dog('poodle', 'white')

st.help(fido)
Copy

And if you're using Magic, you can get help for functions, classes, and modules without even typing st.help:

import streamlit as st
import pandas

# Get help for Pandas read_csv:
pandas.read_csv

# Get help for Streamlit itself:
st
Copy

Streamlit in Snowflake

A simulated Streamlit app to check the correctness of displayed elements and outputs.

An instance of AppTest simulates a running Streamlit app. This class provides methods to set up, manipulate, and inspect the app contents via API instead of a browser UI. It can be used to write automated tests of an app in various scenarios. These can then be run using a tool like pytest.

AppTest can be initialized by one of three class methods:

st.testing.v1.AppTest.from_file (recommended)
st.testing.v1.AppTest.from_string
st.testing.v1.AppTest.from_function

Once initialized, Session State and widget values can be updated and the script can be run. Unlike an actual live-running Streamlit app, you need to call AppTest.run() explicitly to re-run the app after changing a widget value.

AppTest enables developers to build tests on their app as-is, in the familiar python test format, without major refactoring or abstracting out logic to be tested separately from the UI. Tests can run quickly with very low overhead. A typical pattern is to build a suite of tests for an app that ensure consistent functionality as the app evolves, and run the tests locally and/or in a CI environment like Github Actions.

Note

AppTest only supports testing a single page of an app per instance. For multipage apps, each page will need to be tested separately. No methods exist to programatically switch pages within AppTest.

Streamlit in Snowflake

Create an instance of AppTest to simulate an app page defined within a file.

This option is most convenient for CI workflows and testing of published apps. The script must be executable on its own and so must contain all necessary imports.

Function signature
[source]

AppTest.from_file(cls, script_path, *, default_timeout=3)

Parameters

script_path (str)

Path to a script file. The path should be absolute or relative to the file calling .from_file.

default_timeout (float)

Default time in seconds before a script run is timed out. Can be overridden for individual .run() calls.

Returns

(AppTest)

A simulated Streamlit app for testing. The simulated app can be executed via .run().

AppTest.from_string

Create an instance of AppTest to simulate an app page defined within a string.

This is useful for testing short scripts that fit comfortably as an inline string in the test itself, without having to create a separate file for it. The script must be executable on its own and so must contain all necessary imports.

Function signature
[source]

AppTest.from_string(cls, script, *, default_timeout=3)

Parameters

script (str)

The string contents of the script to be run.

default_timeout (float)

Default time in seconds before a script run is timed out. Can be overridden for individual .run() calls.

Returns

(AppTest)

A simulated Streamlit app for testing. The simulated app can be executed via .run().

Streamlit in Snowflake

Create an instance of AppTest to simulate an app page defined within a function.

This is similar to AppTest.from_string(), but more convenient to write with IDE assistance. The script must be executable on its own and so must contain all necessary imports.

Function signature
[source]

AppTest.from_function(cls, script, *, default_timeout=3)

Parameters

script (Callable)

A function whose body will be used as a script. Must be runnable in isolation, so it must include any necessary imports.

default_timeout (float)

Default time in seconds before a script run is timed out. Can be overridden for individual .run() calls.

Returns

(AppTest)

A simulated Streamlit app for testing. The simulated app can be executed via .run().

Run the script from the current state.

This is equivalent to manually rerunning the app or the rerun that occurs upon user interaction. AppTest.run() must be manually called after updating a widget value as script reruns do not occur automatically as they do for live-running Streamlit apps.

Function signature
[source]

AppTest.run(*, timeout=None)

Parameters

timeout (null)

The maximum number of seconds to run the script. None means use the default timeout set for the instance of AppTest.

Returns

(AppTest)

self

Get AppTest script elements

The main value of AppTest is providing an API to programmatically inspect and interact with the elements and widgets produced by a running Streamlit app. Using the AppTest.<element type> properties or AppTest.get() method returns a collection of all the elements or widgets of the specified type that would have been displayed by running the app.

Note that you can also retrieve elements within a specific container in the same way - first retrieve the container, then retrieve the elements just in that container.

Function signature
[source]

AppTest.get(element_type)

Parameters

element_type (str)

An element attribute of AppTest. For example, "button", "caption", or "chat_input".

Returns

(Sequence of Elements)

Sequence of elements of the given type. Individual elements can be accessed from a Sequence by index (order on the page). When getting and element_type that is a widget, individual widgets can be accessed by key. For example, at.get("text")[0] for the first st.text element or at.get("slider")(key="my_key") for the st.slider widget with a given key.

st.testing.v1.element_tree.Block

The Block class has the same methods and attributes as AppTest. A Block instance represents a container of elements just as AppTest represents the entire app. For example, Block.button will produce a WidgetList of Button in the same manner as AppTest.button.

ChatMessage, Column, and Tab all inherit from Block. For all container classes, parameters of the original element can be obtained as properties. For example, ChatMessage.avatar and Tab.label.

Element base class for testing.

This class's methods and attributes are universal for all elements implemented in testing. For example, Caption, Code, Text, and Title inherit from Element. All widget classes also inherit from Element, but have additional methods specific to each widget type. See the AppTest class for the full list of supported elements.

For all element classes, parameters of the original element can be obtained as properties. For example, Button.label, Caption.help, and Toast.icon.

Display a short message, known as a notification "toast".

The toast appears in the app's bottom-right corner and disappears after four seconds.

Warning

st.toast is not compatible with Streamlit's caching and cannot be called within a cached function.

Function signature
[source]

st.toast(body, *, icon=None)

Parameters

body (str)

The string to display as Github-flavored Markdown. Syntax information can be found at: https://github.github.com/gfm.

This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1: and :sunglasses:. For a list of all supported codes, see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

icon (str or None)

An optional argument that specifies an emoji to use as the icon for the toast. Shortcodes are not allowed, please use a single character instead. E.g. "üö®", "üî•", "ü§ñ", etc. Defaults to None, which means no icon is displayed.

Example
import streamlit as st

st.toast('Your edited image was saved!', icon='üòç')
Copy

When multiple toasts are generated, they will stack. Hovering over a toast will stop it from disappearing. When hovering ends, the toast will disappear after four more seconds.

import streamlit as st
import time

if st.button('Three cheers'):
    st.toast('Hip!')
    time.sleep(.5)
    st.toast('Hip!')
    time.sleep(.5)
    st.toast('Hooray!', icon='üéâ')


Toast messages can also be updated. Assign st.toast(my_message) to a variable and use the .toast() method to update it. Note: if a toast has already disappeared or been dismissed, the update will not be seen.

import streamlit as st
import time

def cook_breakfast():
    msg = st.toast('Gathering ingredients...')
    time.sleep(1)
    msg.toast('Cooking...')
    time.sleep(1)
    msg.toast('Ready!', icon = "ü•û")

if st.button('Cook breakfast'):
    cook_breakfast()

Streamlit in Snowflake

A read-only, dict-like object for accessing information about current user.

st.experimental_user is dependant on the host platform running the Streamlit app. If the host platform has not configured the function, it will behave as it does in a locally running app.

Properties can by accessed via key or attribute notation. For example, st.experimental_user["email"] or st.experimental_user.email.

Class description
[source]

st.experimental_user()

Methods

to_dict()

Get user info as a dictionary.

Attributes

email (str)

If running locally, this property returns the string literal "test@example.com".

If running on Streamlit Community Cloud, this property returns one of two values:

None if the user is not logged in or not a member of the app's workspace. Such users appear under anonymous pseudonyms in the app's analytics.
The user's email if the the user is logged in and a member of the app's workspace. Such users are identified by their email in the app's analytics.
Examples

The ability to personalize apps for the user viewing the app is a great way to make your app more engaging.

It unlocks a plethora of use-cases for developers, some of which could include: showing additional controls for admins, visualizing a user's Streamlit history, a personalized stock ticker, a chatbot app, and much more. We're excited to see what you build with this feature!

Here's a code snippet that shows extra buttons for admins:

# Show extra buttons for admin users.
ADMIN_USERS = {
    'person1@email.com',
    'person2@email.com',
    'person3@email.com'
}
if st.experimental_user.email in ADMIN_USERS:
    display_the_extra_admin_buttons()
display_the_interface_everyone_sees()


Show different content to users based on their email address:

# Show different content based on the user's email address.
if st.experimental_user.email == 'jane@email.com':
    display_jane_content()
elif st.experimental_user.email == 'adam@foocorp.io':
    display_adam_content()
else:
    st.write("Please contact us to get access!")


Greet users with their name that's stored in a database:

# Greet the user by their name.
if st.experimental_user.email:
    # Get the user's name from the database.
    name = get_name_from_db(st.experimental_user.email)
    st.write('Hello, %s!' % name)

Function signature
[source]

st.experimental_user.to_dict()

Returns

(Dict[str,str])

A dictionary of the current user's information.

Streamlit in Snowflake

A connection to a SQL database using a SQLAlchemy Engine. Initialize using st.connection("<name>", type="sql").

SQLConnection provides the query() convenience method, which can be used to run simple read-only queries with both caching and simple error handling/retries. More complex DB interactions can be performed by using the .session property to receive a regular SQLAlchemy Session.

SQLConnections should always be created using st.connection(), not initialized directly. Connection parameters for a SQLConnection can be specified using either st.secrets or **kwargs. Some frequently used parameters include:

url or arguments for sqlalchemy.engine.URL.create(). Most commonly it includes a dialect, host, database, username and password.
create_engine_kwargs can be passed via st.secrets, such as for snowflake-sqlalchemy or Google BigQuery. These can also be passed directly as **kwargs to connection().
autocommit=True to run with isolation level AUTOCOMMIT. Default is False.
Class description
[source]

st.connections.SQLConnection(connection_name, **kwargs)

Methods

connect()

Call .connect() on the underlying SQLAlchemy Engine, returning a new sqlalchemy.engine.Connection object.

query(sql, *, show_spinner="Running `sql.query(...)`.", ttl=None, index_col=None, chunksize=None, params=None, **kwargs)

Run a read-only query.

reset()

Reset this connection so that it gets reinitialized the next time it's used.

Attributes

driver

The name of the driver used by the underlying SQLAlchemy Engine.

engine

The underlying SQLAlchemy Engine.

session

Return a SQLAlchemy Session.

Example
import streamlit as st

conn = st.connection("sql")
df = conn.query("select * from pet_owners")
st.dataframe(df)
Copy
Basic usage:

SQLAlchemy and any required drivers must be installed to use this connection.

import streamlit as st

conn = st.connection("sql")
df = conn.query("select * from pet_owners")
st.dataframe(df)


In case you want to pass a connection URL (or other parameters) directly, it also works:

conn = st.connection(
    "local_db",
    type="sql",
    url="mysql://user:pass@localhost:3306/mydb"
)


Or specify parameters in secrets:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml
[connections.mydb]
dialect = "mysql"
username = "myuser"
password = "password"
host = "localhost"
database = "mydb"

# streamlit_app.py
conn = st.connection("mydb", type="sql", autocommit=True)


As described above, some cloud databases use extra **kwargs to specify credentials. These can be passed via secrets using the create_engine_kwargs section:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml
[connections.snowflake]
url = "snowflake://<username>@<account>/"

[connections.snowflake.create_engine_kwargs.connect_args]
authenticator = "externalbrowser"
role = "..."
# ...

Streamlit in Snowflake

Run a read-only query.

This method implements both query result caching (with caching behavior identical to that of using @st.cache_data) as well as simple error handling/retries.

Note

Queries that are run without a specified ttl are cached indefinitely.

Aside from the ttl kwarg, all kwargs passed to this function are passed down to pandas.read_sql and have the behavior described in the pandas documentation.

Function signature
[source]

SQLConnection.query(sql, *, show_spinner="Running `sql.query(...)`.", ttl=None, index_col=None, chunksize=None, params=None, **kwargs)

Parameters

sql (str)

The read-only SQL query to execute.

show_spinner (boolean or string)

Enable the spinner. The default is to show a spinner when there is a "cache miss" and the cached resource is being created. If a string, the value of the show_spinner param will be used for the spinner text.

ttl (float, int, timedelta or None)

The maximum number of seconds to keep results in the cache, or None if cached results should not expire. The default is None.

index_col (str, list of str, or None)

Column(s) to set as index(MultiIndex). Default is None.

chunksize (int or None)

If specified, return an iterator where chunksize is the number of rows to include in each chunk. Default is None.

params (list, tuple, dict or None)

List of parameters to pass to the execute method. The syntax used to pass parameters is database driver dependent. Check your database driver documentation for which of the five syntax styles, described in PEP 249 paramstyle, is supported. Default is None.

**kwargs (dict)

Additional keyword arguments are passed to pandas.read_sql.

Returns

(pandas.DataFrame)

The result of running the query, formatted as a pandas DataFrame.

Example
import streamlit as st

conn = st.connection("sql")
df = conn.query("select * from pet_owners where owner = :owner", ttl=3600, params={"owner":"barbara"})
st.dataframe(df)

Reset this connection so that it gets reinitialized the next time it's used.

This method can be useful when a connection has become stale, an auth token has expired, or in similar scenarios where a broken connection might be fixed by reinitializing it. Note that some connection methods may already use reset() in their error handling code.

Function signature
[source]

SQLConnection.reset()

Example
import streamlit as st

conn = st.connection("my_conn")

# Reset the connection before using it if it isn't healthy
# Note: is_healthy() isn't a real method and is just shown for example here.
if not conn.is_healthy():
    conn.reset()

# Do stuff with conn...

Return a SQLAlchemy Session.

Users of this connection should use the contextmanager pattern for writes, transactions, and anything more complex than simple read queries.

See the usage example below, which assumes we have a table numbers with a single integer column val. The SQLAlchemy docs also contain much more information on the usage of sessions.

Function signature
[source]

SQLConnection.session

Example
import streamlit as st
conn = st.connection("sql")
n = st.slider("Pick a number")
if st.button("Add the number!"):
    with conn.session as session:
        session.execute("INSERT INTO numbers (val) VALUES (:n);", {"n": n})
        session.commit()

Streamlit in Snowflake

The abstract base class that all Streamlit Connections must inherit from.

This base class provides connection authors with a standardized way to hook into the st.connection() factory function: connection authors are required to provide an implementation for the abstract method _connect in their subclasses.

Additionally, it also provides a few methods/properties designed to make implementation of connections more convenient. See the docstrings for each of the methods of this class for more information

Note

While providing an implementation of _connect is technically all that's required to define a valid connection, connections should also provide the user with context-specific ways of interacting with the underlying connection object. For example, the first-party SQLConnection provides a query() method for reads and a session property for more complex operations.

Reset this connection so that it gets reinitialized the next time it's used.

This method can be useful when a connection has become stale, an auth token has expired, or in similar scenarios where a broken connection might be fixed by reinitializing it. Note that some connection methods may already use reset() in their error handling code.

Example
import streamlit as st

conn = st.connection("my_conn")

# Reset the connection before using it if it isn't healthy
# Note: is_healthy() isn't a real method and is just shown for example here.
if not conn.is_healthy():
    conn.reset()

# Do stuff with conn...

Streamlit in Snowflake

A connection to Snowflake using the Snowflake Python Connector. Initialize using

st.connection("<name>", type="snowflake").

SnowflakeConnection supports direct SQL querying using .query("..."), access to the underlying Snowflake Python Connector object with .raw_connection, and other convenience functions. See the methods below for more information. SnowflakeConnections should always be created using st.connection(), not initialized directly.

Class description
[source]

st.connections.SnowflakeConnection(connection_name, **kwargs)

Methods

cursor()

Return a PEP 249-compliant cursor object.

query(sql, *, ttl=None, show_spinner="Running `snowflake.query(...)`.", params=None, **kwargs)

Run a read-only SQL query.

reset()

Reset this connection so that it gets reinitialized the next time it's used.

session()

Create a new Snowpark Session from this connection.

write_pandas(df, table_name, database=None, schema=None, chunk_size=None, **kwargs)

Call snowflake.connector.pandas_tools.write_pandas with this connection.

Attributes

raw_connection

Access the underlying Snowflake Python connector object.

Configuration

st.connection("snowflake") can be configured using Streamlit secrets or keyword args just like any other connection. It can also use existing Snowflake connection configuration when available.

Note that snowflake-snowpark-python must be installed to use this connection.

Using Streamlit secrets

For example, if your Snowflake account supports SSO, you can set up a quick local connection for development using browser-based SSO and secrets.toml as follows:

# .streamlit/secrets.toml

[connections.snowflake]
account = "<ACCOUNT ID>"
user = "<USERNAME>"
authenticator = "EXTERNALBROWSER"


Learn more about account indentifier here. You could also specify the full configuration and credentials in your secrets file, as in the example here.

Using existing Snowflake configuration

Snowflake's python driver also supports a connection configuration file, which is well integrated with Streamlit SnowflakeConnection. If you already have one or more connections configured, all you need to do is pass Streamlit the name of the connection to use. This can be done in several ways:

Set connection_name in your app code, such as st.connnection("<name>", type="snowflake").
Set connection_name = "<name>" in the [connections.snowflake] section of your Streamlit secrets.
Set the environment variable SNOWFLAKE_DEFAULT_CONNECTION_NAME=<name>.
Set a default connection in your Snowflake configuration.

When available in Streamlit in Snowflake, st.connection("snowflake") will connect automatically using the app owner role and does not require any configuration.

Learn more about setting up connections in the Connecting Streamlit to Snowflake tutorial and Connecting to data.

Run a read-only SQL query.

This method implements both query result caching (with caching behavior identical to that of using @st.cache_data) as well as simple error handling/retries.

Note

Queries that are run without a specified ttl are cached indefinitely.

Function signature
[source]

SnowflakeConnection.query(sql, *, ttl=None, show_spinner="Running `snowflake.query(...)`.", params=None, **kwargs)

Parameters

sql (str)

The read-only SQL query to execute.

ttl (float, int, timedelta or None)

The maximum number of seconds to keep results in the cache, or None if cached results should not expire. The default is None.

show_spinner (boolean or string)

Enable the spinner. The default is to show a spinner when there is a "cache miss" and the cached resource is being created. If a string, the value of the show_spinner param will be used for the spinner text.

params (list, tuple, dict or None)

List of parameters to pass to the execute method. This connector supports binding data to a SQL statement using qmark bindings. For more information and examples, see the Snowflake Python Connector documentation. Default is None.

Returns

(pandas.DataFrame)

The result of running the query, formatted as a pandas DataFrame.

Example
import streamlit as st

conn = st.connection("snowflake")
df = conn.query("select * from pet_owners")
st.dataframe(df)

Streamlit in Snowflake

Decorator to cache functions that return data (e.g. dataframe transforms, database queries, ML inference).

Cached objects are stored in "pickled" form, which means that the return value of a cached function must be pickleable. Each caller of the cached function gets its own copy of the cached data.

You can clear a function's cache with func.clear() or clear the entire cache with st.cache_data.clear().

To cache global resources, use st.cache_resource instead. Learn more about caching at https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching.

Function signature
[source]

st.cache_data(func=None, *, ttl, max_entries, show_spinner, persist, experimental_allow_widgets, hash_funcs=None)

Parameters

func (callable)

The function to cache. Streamlit hashes the function's source code.

ttl (float, timedelta, str, or None)

The maximum time to keep an entry in the cache. Can be one of:

None if cache entries should never expire (default).
A number specifying the time in seconds.
A string specifying the time in a format supported by Pandas's Timedelta constructor, e.g. "1d", "1.5 days", or "1h23s".
A timedelta object from Python's built-in datetime library, e.g. timedelta(days=1).

Note that ttl will be ignored if persist="disk" or persist=True.

max_entries (int or None)

The maximum number of entries to keep in the cache, or None for an unbounded cache. When a new entry is added to a full cache, the oldest cached entry will be removed. Defaults to None.

show_spinner (bool or str)

Enable the spinner. Default is True to show a spinner when there is a "cache miss" and the cached data is being created. If string, value of show_spinner param will be used for spinner text.

persist ("disk", bool, or None)

Optional location to persist cached data to. Passing "disk" (or True) will persist the cached data to the local disk. None (or False) will disable persistence. The default is None.

experimental_allow_widgets (bool)

Allow widgets to be used in the cached function. Defaults to False. Support for widgets in cached functions is currently experimental. Setting this parameter to True may lead to excessive memory use since the widget value is treated as an additional input parameter to the cache. We may remove support for this option at any time without notice.

hash_funcs (dict or None)

Mapping of types or fully qualified names to hash functions. This is used to override the behavior of the hasher inside Streamlit's caching mechanism: when the hasher encounters an object, it will first check to see if its type matches a key in this dict and, if so, will use the provided function to generate a hash for it. See below for an example of how this can be used.

Example
import streamlit as st

@st.cache_data
def fetch_and_clean_data(url):
    # Fetch data from URL here, and then clean it up.
    return data

d1 = fetch_and_clean_data(DATA_URL_1)
# Actually executes the function, since this is the first time it was
# encountered.

d2 = fetch_and_clean_data(DATA_URL_1)
# Does not execute the function. Instead, returns its previously computed
# value. This means that now the data in d1 is the same as in d2.

d3 = fetch_and_clean_data(DATA_URL_2)
# This is a different URL, so the function executes.
Copy

To set the persist parameter, use this command as follows:

import streamlit as st

@st.cache_data(persist="disk")
def fetch_and_clean_data(url):
    # Fetch data from URL here, and then clean it up.
    return data
Copy

By default, all parameters to a cached function must be hashable. Any parameter whose name begins with _ will not be hashed. You can use this as an "escape hatch" for parameters that are not hashable:

import streamlit as st

@st.cache_data
def fetch_and_clean_data(_db_connection, num_rows):
    # Fetch data from _db_connection here, and then clean it up.
    return data

connection = make_database_connection()
d1 = fetch_and_clean_data(connection, num_rows=10)
# Actually executes the function, since this is the first time it was
# encountered.

another_connection = make_database_connection()
d2 = fetch_and_clean_data(another_connection, num_rows=10)
# Does not execute the function. Instead, returns its previously computed
# value - even though the _database_connection parameter was different
# in both calls.
Copy

A cached function's cache can be procedurally cleared:

import streamlit as st

@st.cache_data
def fetch_and_clean_data(_db_connection, num_rows):
    # Fetch data from _db_connection here, and then clean it up.
    return data

fetch_and_clean_data.clear()
# Clear all cached entries for this function.
Copy

To override the default hashing behavior, pass a custom hash function. You can do that by mapping a type (e.g. datetime.datetime) to a hash function (lambda dt: dt.isoformat()) like this:

import streamlit as st
import datetime

@st.cache_data(hash_funcs={datetime.datetime: lambda dt: dt.isoformat()})
def convert_to_utc(dt: datetime.datetime):
    return dt.astimezone(datetime.timezone.utc)
Copy

Alternatively, you can map the type's fully-qualified name (e.g. "datetime.datetime") to the hash function instead:

import streamlit as st
import datetime

@st.cache_data(hash_funcs={"datetime.datetime": lambda dt: dt.isoformat()})
def convert_to_utc(dt: datetime.datetime):
    return dt.astimezone(datetime.timezone.utc)
Copy
priority_high
Warning

st.cache_data implicitly uses the pickle module, which is known to be insecure. Anything your cached function returns is pickled and stored, then unpickled on retrieval. Ensure your cached functions return trusted values because it is possible to construct malicious pickle data that will execute arbitrary code during unpickling. Never load data that could have come from an untrusted source in an unsafe mode or that could have been tampered with. Only load data you trust.

Streamlit in Snowflake

Clear all in-memory and on-disk data caches.

Function signature
[source]

st.cache_data.clear()

Example

In the example below, pressing the "Clear All" button will clear memoized values from all functions decorated with @st.cache_data.

import streamlit as st

@st.cache_data
def square(x):
    return x**2

@st.cache_data
def cube(x):
    return x**3

if st.button("Clear All"):
    # Clear values from *all* all in-memory and on-disk data caches:
    # i.e. clear values from both square and cube
    st.cache_data.clear()

Using Streamlit commands in cached functions
Static elements

Since version 1.16.0, cached functions can contain Streamlit commands! For example, you can do this:

@st.cache_data
def get_api_data():
    data = api.get(...)
    st.success("Fetched data from API!")  # üëà Show a success message
    return data


As we know, Streamlit only runs this function if it hasn‚Äôt been cached before. On this first run, the st.success message will appear in the app. But what happens on subsequent runs? It still shows up! Streamlit realizes that there is an st. command inside the cached function, saves it during the first run, and replays it on subsequent runs. Replaying static elements works for both caching decorators.

You can also use this functionality to cache entire parts of your UI:

@st.cache_data
def show_data():
    st.header("Data analysis")
    data = api.get(...)
    st.success("Fetched data from API!")
    st.write("Here is a plot of the data:")
    st.line_chart(data)
    st.write("And here is the raw data:")
    st.dataframe(data)

Input widgets

You can also use interactive input widgets like st.slider or st.text_input in cached functions. Widget replay is an experimental feature at the moment. To enable it, you need to set the experimental_allow_widgets parameter:

@st.cache_data(experimental_allow_widgets=True)  # üëà Set the parameter
def get_data():
    num_rows = st.slider("Number of rows to get")  # üëà Add a slider
    data = api.get(..., num_rows)
    return data


Streamlit treats the slider like an additional input parameter to the cached function. If you change the slider position, Streamlit will see if it has already cached the function for this slider value. If yes, it will return the cached value. If not, it will rerun the function using the new slider value.

Using widgets in cached functions is extremely powerful because it lets you cache entire parts of your app. But it can be dangerous! Since Streamlit treats the widget value as an additional input parameter, it can easily lead to excessive memory usage. Imagine your cached function has five sliders and returns a 100 MB DataFrame. Then we‚Äôll add 100 MB to the cache for every permutation of these five slider values ‚Äì even if the sliders do not influence the returned data! These additions can make your cache explode very quickly. Please be aware of this limitation if you use widgets in cached functions. We recommend using this feature only for isolated parts of your UI where the widgets directly influence the cached return value.

Warning

Support for widgets in cached functions is currently experimental. We may change or remove it anytime without warning. Please use it with care!

push_pin
Note

Two widgets are currently not supported in cached functions: st.file_uploader and st.camera_input. We may support them in the future. Feel free to open a GitHub issue if you need them!

Streamlit in Snowflake

Create a new connection to a data store or API, or return an existing one.

Config options, credentials, secrets, etc. for connections are taken from various sources:

Any connection-specific configuration files.
An app's secrets.toml files.
The kwargs passed to this function.
Function signature
[source]

st.connection(name, type=None, max_entries=None, ttl=None, **kwargs)

Parameters

name (str)

The connection name used for secrets lookup in [connections.<name>]. Type will be inferred from passing "sql", "snowflake", or "snowpark".

type (str, connection class, or None)

The type of connection to create. It can be a keyword ("sql", "snowflake", or "snowpark"), a path to an importable class, or an imported class reference. All classes must extend st.connections.BaseConnection and implement the _connect() method. If the type kwarg is None, a type field must be set in the connection's section in secrets.toml.

max_entries (int or None)

The maximum number of connections to keep in the cache, or None for an unbounded cache. (When a new entry is added to a full cache, the oldest cached entry will be removed.) The default is None.

ttl (float, timedelta, or None)

The maximum number of seconds to keep results in the cache, or None if cached results should not expire. The default is None.

**kwargs (any)

Additional connection specific kwargs that are passed to the Connection's _connect() method. Learn more from the specific Connection's documentation.

Returns

(Connection object)

An initialized Connection object of the specified type.

Examples

The easiest way to create a first-party (SQL, Snowflake, or Snowpark) connection is to use their default names and define corresponding sections in your secrets.toml file.

import streamlit as st
conn = st.connection("sql") # Config section defined in [connections.sql] in secrets.toml.
Copy

Creating a SQLConnection with a custom name requires you to explicitly specify the type. If type is not passed as a kwarg, it must be set in the appropriate section of secrets.toml.

import streamlit as st
conn1 = st.connection("my_sql_connection", type="sql") # Config section defined in [connections.my_sql_connection].
conn2 = st.connection("my_other_sql_connection") # type must be set in [connections.my_other_sql_connection].
Copy

Passing the full module path to the connection class that you want to use can be useful, especially when working with a custom connection:

import streamlit as st
conn = st.connection("my_sql_connection", type="streamlit.connections.SQLConnection")
Copy

Finally, you can pass the connection class to use directly to this function. Doing so allows static type checking tools such as mypy to infer the exact return type of st.connection.

import streamlit as st
from streamlit.connections import SQLConnection
conn = st.connection("my_sql_connection", type=SQLConnection)
Copy

For a comprehensive overview of this feature, check out this video tutorial by Joshua Carroll, Streamlit's Product Manager for Developer Experience. You'll learn about the feature's utility in creating and managing data connections within your apps by using real-world examples.

Streamlit in Snowflake

Decorator to cache functions that return global resources (e.g. database connections, ML models).

Cached objects are shared across all users, sessions, and reruns. They must be thread-safe because they can be accessed from multiple threads concurrently. If thread safety is an issue, consider using st.session_state to store resources per session instead.

You can clear a function's cache with func.clear() or clear the entire cache with st.cache_resource.clear().

To cache data, use st.cache_data instead. Learn more about caching at https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching.

Function signature
[source]

st.cache_resource(func, *, ttl, max_entries, show_spinner, validate, experimental_allow_widgets, hash_funcs=None)

Parameters

func (callable)

The function that creates the cached resource. Streamlit hashes the function's source code.

ttl (float, timedelta, str, or None)

The maximum time to keep an entry in the cache. Can be one of:

None if cache entries should never expire (default).
A number specifying the time in seconds.
A string specifying the time in a format supported by Pandas's Timedelta constructor, e.g. "1d", "1.5 days", or "1h23s".
A timedelta object from Python's built-in datetime library, e.g. timedelta(days=1).

max_entries (int or None)

The maximum number of entries to keep in the cache, or None for an unbounded cache. When a new entry is added to a full cache, the oldest cached entry will be removed. Defaults to None.

show_spinner (bool or str)

Enable the spinner. Default is True to show a spinner when there is a "cache miss" and the cached resource is being created. If string, value of show_spinner param will be used for spinner text.

validate (callable or None)

An optional validation function for cached data. validate is called each time the cached value is accessed. It receives the cached value as its only parameter and it must return a boolean. If validate returns False, the current cached value is discarded, and the decorated function is called to compute a new value. This is useful e.g. to check the health of database connections.

experimental_allow_widgets (bool)

Allow widgets to be used in the cached function. Defaults to False. Support for widgets in cached functions is currently experimental. Setting this parameter to True may lead to excessive memory use since the widget value is treated as an additional input parameter to the cache. We may remove support for this option at any time without notice.

hash_funcs (dict or None)

Mapping of types or fully qualified names to hash functions. This is used to override the behavior of the hasher inside Streamlit's caching mechanism: when the hasher encounters an object, it will first check to see if its type matches a key in this dict and, if so, will use the provided function to generate a hash for it. See below for an example of how this can be used.

Example
import streamlit as st

@st.cache_resource
def get_database_session(url):
    # Create a database session object that points to the URL.
    return session

s1 = get_database_session(SESSION_URL_1)
# Actually executes the function, since this is the first time it was
# encountered.

s2 = get_database_session(SESSION_URL_1)
# Does not execute the function. Instead, returns its previously computed
# value. This means that now the connection object in s1 is the same as in s2.

s3 = get_database_session(SESSION_URL_2)
# This is a different URL, so the function executes.
Copy

By default, all parameters to a cache_resource function must be hashable. Any parameter whose name begins with _ will not be hashed. You can use this as an "escape hatch" for parameters that are not hashable:

import streamlit as st

@st.cache_resource
def get_database_session(_sessionmaker, url):
    # Create a database connection object that points to the URL.
    return connection

s1 = get_database_session(create_sessionmaker(), DATA_URL_1)
# Actually executes the function, since this is the first time it was
# encountered.

s2 = get_database_session(create_sessionmaker(), DATA_URL_1)
# Does not execute the function. Instead, returns its previously computed
# value - even though the _sessionmaker parameter was different
# in both calls.
Copy

A cache_resource function's cache can be procedurally cleared:

import streamlit as st

@st.cache_resource
def get_database_session(_sessionmaker, url):
    # Create a database connection object that points to the URL.
    return connection

get_database_session.clear()
# Clear all cached entries for this function.
Copy

To override the default hashing behavior, pass a custom hash function. You can do that by mapping a type (e.g. Person) to a hash function (str) like this:

import streamlit as st
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Person(BaseModel):
    name: str

@st.cache_resource(hash_funcs={Person: str})
def get_person_name(person: Person):
    return person.name
Copy

Alternatively, you can map the type's fully-qualified name (e.g. "__main__.Person") to the hash function instead:

import streamlit as st
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Person(BaseModel):
    name: str

@st.cache_resource(hash_funcs={"__main__.Person": str})
def get_person_name(person: Person):
    return person.name
Copy
st.cache_resource.clear

Streamlit in Snowflake

Clear all cache_resource caches.

Function signature
[source]

st.cache_resource.clear()

Example

In the example below, pressing the "Clear All" button will clear all cache_resource caches. i.e. Clears cached global resources from all functions decorated with @st.cache_resource.

import streamlit as st
from transformers import BertModel

@st.cache_resource
 def get_database_session(url):
     # Create a database session object that points to the URL.
     return session

@st.cache_resource
def get_model(model_type):
    # Create a model of the specified type.
    return BertModel.from_pretrained(model_type)

if st.button("Clear All"):
    # Clears all st.cache_resource caches:
    st.cache_resource.clear()

Using Streamlit commands in cached functions
Static elements

Since version 1.16.0, cached functions can contain Streamlit commands! For example, you can do this:

from transformers import pipeline

@st.cache_resource
def load_model():
    model = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
    st.success("Loaded NLP model from Hugging Face!")  # üëà Show a success message
    return model


As we know, Streamlit only runs this function if it hasn‚Äôt been cached before. On this first run, the st.success message will appear in the app. But what happens on subsequent runs? It still shows up! Streamlit realizes that there is an st. command inside the cached function, saves it during the first run, and replays it on subsequent runs. Replaying static elements works for both caching decorators.

You can also use this functionality to cache entire parts of your UI:

@st.cache_resource
def load_model():
    st.header("Data analysis")
    model = torchvision.models.resnet50(weights=ResNet50_Weights.DEFAULT)
    st.success("Loaded model!")
    st.write("Turning on evaluation mode...")
    model.eval()
    st.write("Here's the model:")
    return model

Input widgets

You can also use interactive input widgets like st.slider or st.text_input in cached functions. Widget replay is an experimental feature at the moment. To enable it, you need to set the experimental_allow_widgets parameter:

@st.cache_resource(experimental_allow_widgets=True)  # üëà Set the parameter
def load_model():
    pretrained = st.checkbox("Use pre-trained model:")  # üëà Add a checkbox
    model = torchvision.models.resnet50(weights=ResNet50_Weights.DEFAULT, pretrained=pretrained)
    return model


Streamlit treats the checkbox like an additional input parameter to the cached function. If you uncheck it, Streamlit will see if it has already cached the function for this checkbox state. If yes, it will return the cached value. If not, it will rerun the function using the new slider value.

Using widgets in cached functions is extremely powerful because it lets you cache entire parts of your app. But it can be dangerous! Since Streamlit treats the widget value as an additional input parameter, it can easily lead to excessive memory usage. Imagine your cached function has five sliders and returns a 100 MB DataFrame. Then we‚Äôll add 100 MB to the cache for every permutation of these five slider values ‚Äì even if the sliders do not influence the returned data! These additions can make your cache explode very quickly. Please be aware of this limitation if you use widgets in cached functions. We recommend using this feature only for isolated parts of your UI where the widgets directly influence the cached return value.

Streamlit in Snowflake

Create a form that batches elements together with a "Submit" button.

A form is a container that visually groups other elements and widgets together, and contains a Submit button. When the form's Submit button is pressed, all widget values inside the form will be sent to Streamlit in a batch.

To add elements to a form object, you can use "with" notation (preferred) or just call methods directly on the form. See examples below.

Forms have a few constraints:

Every form must contain a st.form_submit_button.
st.button and st.download_button cannot be added to a form.
Forms can appear anywhere in your app (sidebar, columns, etc), but they cannot be embedded inside other forms.
Within a form, the only widget that can have a callback function is st.form_submit_button.
Function signature
[source]

st.form(key, clear_on_submit=False, *, border=True)

Parameters

key (str)

A string that identifies the form. Each form must have its own key. (This key is not displayed to the user in the interface.)

clear_on_submit (bool)

If True, all widgets inside the form will be reset to their default values after the user presses the Submit button. Defaults to False. (Note that Custom Components are unaffected by this flag, and will not be reset to their defaults on form submission.)

border (bool)

Whether to show a border around the form. Defaults to True.

Note

Not showing a border can be confusing to viewers since interacting with a widget in the form will do nothing. You should only remove the border if there's another border (e.g. because of an expander) or the form is small (e.g. just a text input and a submit button).

Examples

Inserting elements using "with" notation:

import streamlit as st

with st.form("my_form"):
   st.write("Inside the form")
   slider_val = st.slider("Form slider")
   checkbox_val = st.checkbox("Form checkbox")

   # Every form must have a submit button.
   submitted = st.form_submit_button("Submit")
   if submitted:
       st.write("slider", slider_val, "checkbox", checkbox_val)

st.write("Outside the form")
Copy

Inserting elements out of order:

import streamlit as st

form = st.form("my_form")
form.slider("Inside the form")
st.slider("Outside the form")

# Now add a submit button to the form:
form.form_submit_button("Submit")
Copy

Streamlit in Snowflake

Configures the default settings of the page.

Note

This must be the first Streamlit command used on an app page, and must only be set once per page.

Function signature
[source]

st.set_page_config(page_title=None, page_icon=None, layout="centered", initial_sidebar_state="auto", menu_items=None)

Parameters

page_title (str or None)

The page title, shown in the browser tab. If None, defaults to the filename of the script ("app.py" would show "app ‚Ä¢ Streamlit").

page_icon (Anything supported by st.image or str or None)

The page favicon. Besides the types supported by st.image (like URLs or numpy arrays), you can pass in an emoji as a string ("ü¶à") or a shortcode (":shark:"). If you're feeling lucky, try "random" for a random emoji! Emoji icons are courtesy of Twemoji and loaded from MaxCDN.

layout ("centered" or "wide")

How the page content should be laid out. Defaults to "centered", which constrains the elements into a centered column of fixed width; "wide" uses the entire screen.

initial_sidebar_state ("auto", "expanded", or "collapsed")

How the sidebar should start out. Defaults to "auto", which hides the sidebar on small devices and shows it otherwise. "expanded" shows the sidebar initially; "collapsed" hides it. In most cases, you should just use "auto", otherwise the app will look bad when embedded and viewed on mobile.

menu_items (dict)

Configure the menu that appears on the top-right side of this app. The keys in this dict denote the menu item you'd like to configure:

"Get help": str or None
The URL this menu item should point to. If None, hides this menu item.
"Report a Bug": str or None
The URL this menu item should point to. If None, hides this menu item.
"About": str or None
A markdown string to show in the About dialog. If None, only shows Streamlit's default About text.

The URL may also refer to an email address e.g. mailto:john@example.com.

Example
import streamlit as st

st.set_page_config(
    page_title="Ex-stream-ly Cool App",
    page_icon="üßä",
    layout="wide",
    initial_sidebar_state="expanded",
    menu_items={
        'Get Help': 'https://www.extremelycoolapp.com/help',
        'Report a bug': "https://www.extremelycoolapp.com/bug",
        'About': "# This is a header. This is an *extremely* cool app!"
    }

Streamlit in Snowflake

Use in a with block to draw some code on the app, then execute it.

Function signature
[source]

st.echo(code_location="above")

Parameters

code_location ("above" or "below")

Whether to show the echoed code before or after the results of the executed code block.

Example
import streamlit as st

with st.echo():
    st.write('This code will be printed')
Copy
Display code

Sometimes you want your Streamlit app to contain both your usual Streamlit graphic elements and the code that generated those elements. That's where st.echo() comes in.

Ok so let's say you have the following file, and you want to make its app a little bit more self-explanatory by making that middle section visible in the Streamlit app:

import streamlit as st

def get_user_name():
    return 'John'

# ------------------------------------------------
# Want people to see this part of the code...

def get_punctuation():
    return '!!!'

greeting = "Hi there, "
user_name = get_user_name()
punctuation = get_punctuation()

st.write(greeting, user_name, punctuation)

# ...up to here
# ------------------------------------------------

foo = 'bar'
st.write('Done!')


The file above creates a Streamlit app containing the words "Hi there, John", and then "Done!".

Now let's use st.echo() to make that middle section of the code visible in the app:

import streamlit as st

def get_user_name():
    return 'John'

with st.echo():
    # Everything inside this block will be both printed to the screen
    # and executed.

    def get_punctuation():
        return '!!!'

    greeting = "Hi there, "
    value = get_user_name()
    punctuation = get_punctuation()

    st.write(greeting, value, punctuation)

# And now we're back to _not_ printing to the screen
foo = 'bar'
st.write('Done!')


It's that simple!

push_pin
Note

You can have multiple st.echo() blocks in the same file. Use it as often as you wish!

Insert a status container to display output from long-running tasks.

Inserts a container into your app that is typically used to show the status and details of a process or task. The container can hold multiple elements and can be expanded or collapsed by the user similar to st.expander. When collapsed, all that is visible is the status icon and label.

The label, state, and expanded state can all be updated by calling .update() on the returned object. To add elements to the returned container, you can use "with" notation (preferred) or just call methods directly on the returned object.

By default, st.status() initializes in the "running" state. When called using "with" notation, it automatically updates to the "complete" state at the end of the "with" block. See examples below for more details.

Function signature
[source]

st.status(label, *, expanded=False, state="running")

Parameters

label (str)

The initial label of the status container. The label can optionally contain Markdown and supports the following elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, Emojis, and Links.

This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1: and :sunglasses:. For a list of all supported codes, see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Display unsupported elements as literal characters by backslash-escaping them. E.g. 1\. Not an ordered list.

expanded (bool)

If True, initializes the status container in "expanded" state. Defaults to False (collapsed).

state ("running", "complete", or "error")

The initial state of the status container which determines which icon is shown:

running (default): A spinner icon is shown.
complete: A checkmark icon is shown.
error: An error icon is shown.
Returns

(StatusContainer)

A mutable status container that can hold multiple elements. The label, state, and expanded state can be updated after creation via .update().

Examples

You can use with notation to insert any element into an status container:

import time
import streamlit as st

with st.status("Downloading data..."):
    st.write("Searching for data...")
    time.sleep(2)
    st.write("Found URL.")
    time.sleep(1)
    st.write("Downloading data...")
    time.sleep(1)

st.button('Rerun')
Copy

You can also use .update() on the container to change the label, state, or expanded state:

import time
import streamlit as st

with st.status("Downloading data...", expanded=True) as status:
    st.write("Searching for data...")
    time.sleep(2)
    st.write("Found URL.")
    time.sleep(1)
    st.write("Downloading data...")
    time.sleep(1)
    status.update(label="Download complete!", state="complete", expanded=False)

st.button('Rerun')
Copy
StatusContainer.update

Update the status container.

Only specified arguments are updated. Container contents and unspecified arguments remain unchanged.

Function signature

Parameters

label (str or None)

A new label of the status container. If None, the label is not changed.

expanded (bool or None)

The new expanded state of the status container. If None, the expanded state is not changed.

state ("running", "complete", "error", or None)

The new state of the status container. This mainly changes the icon. If None, the state is not changed.

Rerun the script immediately.

When st.rerun() is called, the script is halted - no more statements will be run, and the script will be queued to re-run from the top.

Function signature
[source]

st.rerun()

Caveats for
st.rerun

st.rerun is one of the tools to control the logic of your app. While it is great for prototyping, there can be adverse side effects:

Additional script runs may be inefficient and slower.
Excessive reruns may complicate your app's logic and be harder to follow.
If misused, infinite looping may crash your app.

In many cases where st.rerun works, callbacks may be a cleaner alternative. Containers may also be helpful.

A simple example in three variations
Using st.rerun to update an earlier header
import streamlit as st

if "value" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.value = "Title"

##### Option using st.rerun #####
st.header(st.session_state.value)

if st.button("Foo"):
    st.session_state.value = "Foo"
    st.rerun()

Using a callback to update an earlier header
##### Option using a callback #####
st.header(st.session_state.value)

def update_value():
    st.session_state.value = "Bar"

st.button("Bar", on_click=update_value)

Using containers to update an earlier header
##### Option using a container #####
container = st.container()

if st.button("Baz"):
    st.session_state.value = "Baz"

container.header(st.session_state.value)

Display a progress bar.

Function signature
[source]

st.progress(value, text=None)

Parameters

value (int or float)

0 <= value <= 100 for int

0.0 <= value <= 1.0 for float

text (str or None)

A message to display above the progress bar. The text can optionally contain Markdown and supports the following elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, Emojis, and Links.

This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1: and :sunglasses:. For a list of all supported codes, see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Display unsupported elements as literal characters by backslash-escaping them. E.g. 1\. Not an ordered list.

Example

Here is an example of a progress bar increasing over time and disappearing when it reaches completion:

import streamlit as st
import time

progress_text = "Operation in progress. Please wait."
my_bar = st.progress(0, text=progress_text)

for percent_complete in range(100):
    time.sleep(0.01)
    my_bar.progress(percent_complete + 1, text=progress_text)
time.sleep(1)
my_bar.empty()

Display a chat input widget.

Warning

Chat input can only be used once per app page and inside the main area of the app. It cannot be used in the sidebar, columns, expanders, forms or tabs. We plan to support this in the future.

Function signature
[source]

st.chat_input(placeholder="Your message", *, key=None, max_chars=None, disabled=False, on_submit=None, args=None, kwargs=None)

Parameters

placeholder (str)

A placeholder text shown when the chat input is empty. Defaults to "Your message". For accessibility reasons, you should not use an empty string.

key (str or int)

An optional string or integer to use as the unique key for the widget. If this is omitted, a key will be generated for the widget based on its content. Multiple widgets of the same type may not share the same key.

max_chars (int or None)

The maximum number of characters that can be entered. If None (default), there will be no maximum.

disabled (bool)

Whether the chat input should be disabled. Defaults to False.

on_submit (callable)

An optional callback invoked when the chat input's value is submitted.

args (tuple)

An optional tuple of args to pass to the callback.

kwargs (dict)

An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback.

Returns

(str or None)

The current (non-empty) value of the text input widget on the last run of the app, None otherwise.

Examples
import streamlit as st

prompt = st.chat_input("Say something")
if prompt:
    st.write(f"User has sent the following prompt: {prompt}")
Copy

For an overview of the st.chat_input and st.chat_message API, check out this video tutorial by Chanin Nantasenamat (@dataprofessor), a Senior Developer Advocate at Streamlit.

Insert a chat message container.

To add elements to the returned container, you can use with notation (preferred) or just call methods directly on the returned object. See the examples below.

Function signature
[source]

st.chat_message(name, *, avatar=None)

Parameters

name ("user", "assistant", "ai", "human", or str)

The name of the message author. Can be "human"/"user" or "ai"/"assistant" to enable preset styling and avatars.

Currently, the name is not shown in the UI but is only set as an accessibility label. For accessibility reasons, you should not use an empty string.

avatar (str, numpy.ndarray, or BytesIO)

The avatar shown next to the message. Can be one of:

A single emoji, e.g. "üßë‚Äçüíª", "ü§ñ", "ü¶ñ". Shortcodes are not supported.
An image using one of the formats allowed for st.image: path of a local
image file; URL to fetch the image from; an SVG image; array of shape (w,h) or (w,h,1) for a monochrome image, (w,h,3) for a color image, or (w,h,4) for an RGBA image.

If None (default), uses default icons if name is "user", "assistant", "ai", "human" or the first letter of the name value.

Returns

(Container)

A single container that can hold multiple elements.

Examples

You can use with notation to insert any element into an expander

import streamlit as st
import numpy as np

with st.chat_message("user"):
    st.write("Hello üëã")
    st.line_chart(np.random.randn(30, 3))
Copy

Or you can just call methods directly in the returned objects:

import streamlit as st
import numpy as np

message = st.chat_message("assistant")
message.write("Hello human")
message.bar_chart(np.random.randn(30, 3))
Copy

For an overview of the st.chat_message and st.chat_input API, check out this video tutorial by Chanin Nantasenamat (@dataprofessor), a Senior Developer Advocate at Streamlit.

Insert a single-element container.

Inserts a container into your app that can be used to hold a single element. This allows you to, for example, remove elements at any point, or replace several elements at once (using a child multi-element container).

To insert/replace/clear an element on the returned container, you can use "with" notation or just call methods directly on the returned object. See examples below.

Function signature
[source]

st.empty()

Examples

Overwriting elements in-place using "with" notation:

import streamlit as st
import time

with st.empty():
    for seconds in range(60):
        st.write(f"‚è≥ {seconds} seconds have passed")
        time.sleep(1)
    st.write("‚úîÔ∏è 1 minute over!")
Copy

Replacing several elements, then clearing them:

import streamlit as st

placeholder = st.empty()

# Replace the placeholder with some text:
placeholder.text("Hello")

# Replace the text with a chart:
placeholder.line_chart({"data": [1, 5, 2, 6]})

# Replace the chart with several elements:
with placeholder.container():
    st.write("This is one element")
    st.write("This is another")

# Clear all those elements:
placeholder.empty()
Copy

Insert a multi-element container that can be expanded/collapsed.

Inserts a container into your app that can be used to hold multiple elements and can be expanded or collapsed by the user. When collapsed, all that is visible is the provided label.

To add elements to the returned container, you can use "with" notation (preferred) or just call methods directly on the returned object. See examples below.

Warning

Currently, you may not put expanders inside another expander.

Function signature
[source]

st.expander(label, expanded=False)

Parameters

label (str)

A string to use as the header for the expander. The label can optionally contain Markdown and supports the following elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, Emojis, and Links.

This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1: and :sunglasses:. For a list of all supported codes, see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Display unsupported elements as literal characters by backslash-escaping them. E.g. 1\. Not an ordered list.

expanded (bool)

If True, initializes the expander in "expanded" state. Defaults to False (collapsed).

Examples

You can use with notation to insert any element into an expander

import streamlit as st

st.bar_chart({"data": [1, 5, 2, 6, 2, 1]})

with st.expander("See explanation"):
    st.write(\"\"\"
        The chart above shows some numbers I picked for you.
        I rolled actual dice for these, so they're *guaranteed* to
        be random.
    \"\"\")
    st.image("https://static.streamlit.io/examples/dice.jpg")
Copy

Or you can just call methods directly in the returned objects:

import streamlit as st

st.bar_chart({"data": [1, 5, 2, 6, 2, 1]})

expander = st.expander("See explanation")
expander.write(\"\"\"
    The chart above shows some numbers I picked for you.
    I rolled actual dice for these, so they're *guaranteed* to
    be random.
\"\"\")
expander.image("https://static.streamlit.io/examples/dice.jpg")

Display a single-line text input widget.

Function signature
[source]

st.text_input(label, value="", max_chars=None, key=None, type="default", help=None, autocomplete=None, on_change=None, args=None, kwargs=None, *, placeholder=None, disabled=False, label_visibility="visible")

Parameters

label (str)

A short label explaining to the user what this input is for. The label can optionally contain Markdown and supports the following elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, Emojis, and Links.

This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1: and :sunglasses:. For a list of all supported codes, see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Display unsupported elements as literal characters by backslash-escaping them. E.g. 1\. Not an ordered list.

For accessibility reasons, you should never set an empty label (label="") but hide it with label_visibility if needed. In the future, we may disallow empty labels by raising an exception.

value (object or None)

The text value of this widget when it first renders. This will be cast to str internally. If None, will initialize empty and return None until the user provides input. Defaults to empty string.

max_chars (int or None)

Max number of characters allowed in text input.

key (str or int)

An optional string or integer to use as the unique key for the widget. If this is omitted, a key will be generated for the widget based on its content. Multiple widgets of the same type may not share the same key.

type ("default" or "password")

The type of the text input. This can be either "default" (for a regular text input), or "password" (for a text input that masks the user's typed value). Defaults to "default".

help (str)

An optional tooltip that gets displayed next to the input.

autocomplete (str)

An optional value that will be passed to the <input> element's autocomplete property. If unspecified, this value will be set to "new-password" for "password" inputs, and the empty string for "default" inputs. For more details, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete

on_change (callable)

An optional callback invoked when this text input's value changes.

args (tuple)

An optional tuple of args to pass to the callback.

kwargs (dict)

An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback.

placeholder (str or None)

An optional string displayed when the text input is empty. If None, no text is displayed.

disabled (bool)

An optional boolean, which disables the text input if set to True. The default is False.

label_visibility ("visible", "hidden", or "collapsed")

The visibility of the label. If "hidden", the label doesn't show but there is still empty space for it above the widget (equivalent to label=""). If "collapsed", both the label and the space are removed. Default is "visible".

Returns

(str or None)

The current value of the text input widget or None if no value has been provided by the user.

Example
import streamlit as st

title = st.text_input('Movie title', 'Life of Brian')
st.write('The current movie title is', title)
Copy



Text input widgets can customize how to hide their labels with the label_visibility parameter. If "hidden", the label doesn‚Äôt show but there is still empty space for it above the widget (equivalent to label=""). If "collapsed", both the label and the space are removed. Default is "visible". Text input widgets can also be disabled with the disabled parameter, and can display an optional placeholder text when the text input is empty using the placeholder parameter:

import streamlit as st

# Store the initial value of widgets in session state
if "visibility" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.visibility = "visible"
    st.session_state.disabled = False

col1, col2 = st.columns(2)

with col1:
    st.checkbox("Disable text input widget", key="disabled")
    st.radio(
        "Set text input label visibility üëâ",
        key="visibility",
        options=["visible", "hidden", "collapsed"],
    )
    st.text_input(
        "Placeholder for the other text input widget",
        "This is a placeholder",
        key="placeholder",
    )

with col2:
    text_input = st.text_input(
        "Enter some text üëá",
        label_visibility=st.session_state.visibility,
        disabled=st.session_state.disabled,
        placeholder=st.session_state.placeholder,
    )

    if text_input:
        st.write("You entered: ", text_input)

Display a slider widget.

This supports int, float, date, time, and datetime types.

This also allows you to render a range slider by passing a two-element tuple or list as the value.

The difference between st.slider and st.select_slider is that slider only accepts numerical or date/time data and takes a range as input, while select_slider accepts any datatype and takes an iterable set of options.

Note

Integer values exceeding +/- (1<<53) - 1 cannot be accurately stored or returned by the widget due to serialization contstraints between the Python server and JavaScript client. You must handle such numbers as floats, leading to a loss in precision.

Function signature
[source]

st.slider(label, min_value=None, max_value=None, value=None, step=None, format=None, key=None, help=None, on_change=None, args=None, kwargs=None, *, disabled=False, label_visibility="visible")

Parameters

label (str)

A short label explaining to the user what this slider is for. The label can optionally contain Markdown and supports the following elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, Emojis, and Links.

This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1: and :sunglasses:. For a list of all supported codes, see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Display unsupported elements as literal characters by backslash-escaping them. E.g. 1\. Not an ordered list.

For accessibility reasons, you should never set an empty label (label="") but hide it with label_visibility if needed. In the future, we may disallow empty labels by raising an exception.

min_value (a supported type or None)

The minimum permitted value. Defaults to 0 if the value is an int, 0.0 if a float, value - timedelta(days=14) if a date/datetime, time.min if a time

max_value (a supported type or None)

The maximum permitted value. Defaults to 100 if the value is an int, 1.0 if a float, value + timedelta(days=14) if a date/datetime, time.max if a time

value (a supported type or a tuple/list of supported types or None)

The value of the slider when it first renders. If a tuple/list of two values is passed here, then a range slider with those lower and upper bounds is rendered. For example, if set to (1, 10) the slider will have a selectable range between 1 and 10. Defaults to min_value.

step (int, float, timedelta, or None)

The stepping interval. Defaults to 1 if the value is an int, 0.01 if a float, timedelta(days=1) if a date/datetime, timedelta(minutes=15) if a time (or if max_value - min_value < 1 day)

format (str or None)

A printf-style format string controlling how the interface should display numbers. This does not impact the return value. Formatter for int/float supports: %d %e %f %g %i Formatter for date/time/datetime uses Moment.js notation: https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/

key (str or int)

An optional string or integer to use as the unique key for the widget. If this is omitted, a key will be generated for the widget based on its content. Multiple widgets of the same type may not share the same key.

help (str)

An optional tooltip that gets displayed next to the slider.

on_change (callable)

An optional callback invoked when this slider's value changes.

args (tuple)

An optional tuple of args to pass to the callback.

kwargs (dict)

An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback.

disabled (bool)

An optional boolean, which disables the slider if set to True. The default is False.

label_visibility ("visible", "hidden", or "collapsed")

The visibility of the label. If "hidden", the label doesn't show but there is still empty space for it above the widget (equivalent to label=""). If "collapsed", both the label and the space are removed. Default is "visible".

Returns

(int/float/date/time/datetime or tuple of int/float/date/time/datetime)

The current value of the slider widget. The return type will match the data type of the value parameter.

Examples
import streamlit as st

age = st.slider('How old are you?', 0, 130, 25)
st.write("I'm ", age, 'years old')
Copy

And here's an example of a range slider:

import streamlit as st

values = st.slider(
    'Select a range of values',
    0.0, 100.0, (25.0, 75.0))
st.write('Values:', values)
Copy

This is a range time slider:

import streamlit as st
from datetime import time

appointment = st.slider(
    "Schedule your appointment:",
    value=(time(11, 30), time(12, 45)))
st.write("You're scheduled for:", appointment)
Copy

Finally, a datetime slider:

import streamlit as st
from datetime import datetime

start_time = st.slider(
    "When do you start?",
    value=datetime(2020, 1, 1, 9, 30),
    format="MM/DD/YY - hh:mm")
st.write("Start time:", start_time)
Copy

Display a select widget.

Function signature
[source]

st.selectbox(label, options, index=0, format_func=special_internal_function, key=None, help=None, on_change=None, args=None, kwargs=None, *, placeholder="Choose an option", disabled=False, label_visibility="visible")

Parameters

label (str)

A short label explaining to the user what this select widget is for. The label can optionally contain Markdown and supports the following elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, Emojis, and Links.

This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1: and :sunglasses:. For a list of all supported codes, see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Display unsupported elements as literal characters by backslash-escaping them. E.g. 1\. Not an ordered list.

For accessibility reasons, you should never set an empty label (label="") but hide it with label_visibility if needed. In the future, we may disallow empty labels by raising an exception.

options (Iterable)

Labels for the select options in an Iterable. For example, this can be a list, numpy.ndarray, pandas.Series, pandas.DataFrame, or pandas.Index. For pandas.DataFrame, the first column is used. Each label will be cast to str internally by default.

index (int)

The index of the preselected option on first render. If None, will initialize empty and return None until the user selects an option. Defaults to 0 (the first option).

format_func (function)

Function to modify the display of the labels. It receives the option as an argument and its output will be cast to str.

key (str or int)

An optional string or integer to use as the unique key for the widget. If this is omitted, a key will be generated for the widget based on its content. Multiple widgets of the same type may not share the same key.

help (str)

An optional tooltip that gets displayed next to the selectbox.

on_change (callable)

An optional callback invoked when this selectbox's value changes.

args (tuple)

An optional tuple of args to pass to the callback.

kwargs (dict)

An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback.

placeholder (str)

A string to display when no options are selected. Defaults to 'Choose an option'.

disabled (bool)

An optional boolean, which disables the selectbox if set to True. The default is False.

label_visibility ("visible", "hidden", or "collapsed")

The visibility of the label. If "hidden", the label doesn't show but there is still empty space for it above the widget (equivalent to label=""). If "collapsed", both the label and the space are removed. Default is "visible".

Returns

(any)

The selected option or None if no option is selected.

Example
import streamlit as st

option = st.selectbox(
    'How would you like to be contacted?',
    ('Email', 'Home phone', 'Mobile phone'))

st.write('You selected:', option)
Copy

To initialize an empty selectbox, use None as the index value:

import streamlit as st

option = st.selectbox(
   "How would you like to be contacted?",
   ("Email", "Home phone", "Mobile phone"),
   index=None,
   placeholder="Select contact method...",
)

st.write('You selected:', option)
Copy



Select widgets can customize how to hide their labels with the label_visibility parameter. If "hidden", the label doesn‚Äôt show but there is still empty space for it above the widget (equivalent to label=""). If "collapsed", both the label and the space are removed. Default is "visible". Select widgets can also be disabled with the disabled parameter:

import streamlit as st

# Store the initial value of widgets in session state
if "visibility" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.visibility = "visible"
    st.session_state.disabled = False

col1, col2 = st.columns(2)

with col1:
    st.checkbox("Disable selectbox widget", key="disabled")
    st.radio(
        "Set selectbox label visibility üëâ",
        key="visibility",
        options=["visible", "hidden", "collapsed"],
    )

with col2:
    option = st.selectbox(
        "How would you like to be contacted?",
        ("Email", "Home phone", "Mobile phone"),
        label_visibility=st.session_state.visibility,
        disabled=st.session_state.disabled,
    )

LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Display unsupported elements as literal characters by backslash-escaping them. E.g. 1\. Not an ordered list.

For accessibility reasons, you should never set an empty label (label="") but hide it with label_visibility if needed. In the future, we may disallow empty labels by raising an exception.

An optional string or integer to use as the unique key for the widget. If this is omitted, a key will be generated for the widget based on its content. Multiple widgets of the same type may not share the same key.

help (str)

An optional tooltip that gets displayed next to the multiselect.

on_change (callable)

An optional callback invoked when this multiselect's value changes.

args (tuple)

An optional tuple of args to pass to the callback.

max_selections (int)

The max selections that can be selected at a time.

placeholder (str)

A string to display when no options are selected. Defaults to 'Choose an option'.

disabled (bool)

An optional boolean, which disables the multiselect widget if set to True. The default is False. This argument can only be supplied by keyword.

label_visibility ("visible", "hidden", or "collapsed")

The visibility of the label. If "hidden", the label doesn't show but there is still empty space for it above the widget (equivalent to label=""). If "collapsed", both the label and the space are removed. Default is "visible".

(list)

A list with the selected options

Example
import streamlit as st

options = st.multiselect(
    'What are your favorite colors',

An optional tooltip that gets displayed next to the radio.

on_change (callable)

An optional callback invoked when this radio's value changes.

args (tuple)

An optional tuple of args to pass to the callback.

kwargs (dict)

An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback.

disabled (bool)

An optional boolean, which disables the radio button if set to True. The default is False.

horizontal (bool)

An optional boolean, which orients the radio group horizontally. The default is false (vertical buttons).

captions (iterable of str or None)

A list of captions to show below each radio button. If None (default), no captions are shown.

label_visibility ("visible", "hidden", or "collapsed")

The visibility of the label. If "hidden", the label doesn't show but there is still empty space for it above the widget (equivalent to label=""). If "collapsed", both the label and the space are removed. Default is "visible".

Returns

Example
import streamlit as st

genre = st.radio(
    "What's your favorite movie genre",
    [":rainbow[Comedy]", "***Drama***", "Documentary :movie_camera:"],
    captions = ["Laugh out loud.", "Get the popcorn.", "Never stop learning."])

if genre == ':rainbow[Comedy]':
    st.write('You selected comedy.')
else:
    st.write("You didn\'t select comedy.")
Copy

To initialize an empty radio widget, use None as the index value:

# Store the initial value of widgets in session state
if "visibility" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.visibility = "visible"
    st.session_state.disabled = False
    st.session_state.horizontal = False

col1, col2 = st.columns(2)

with col1:
    st.checkbox("Disable radio widget", key="disabled")
    st.checkbox("Orient radio options horizontally", key="horizontal")

Display a link button element.

When clicked, a new tab will be opened to the specified URL. This will create a new session for the user if directed within the app.

Function signature
[source]

st.link_button(label, url, *, help=None, type="secondary", disabled=False, use_container_width=False)

Parameters

label (str)

A short label explaining to the user what this button is for. The label can optionally contain Markdown and supports the following elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, and Emojis.

This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1: and :sunglasses:. For a list of all supported codes, see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Display unsupported elements as literal characters by backslash-escaping them. E.g. 1\. Not an ordered list.

Display a toggle widget.

Function signature
[source]

st.toggle(label, value=False, key=None, help=None, on_change=None, args=None, kwargs=None, *, disabled=False, label_visibility="visible")

Parameters

label (str)

A short label explaining to the user what this toggle is for. The label can optionally contain Markdown and supports the following elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, Emojis, and Links.

This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1: and :sunglasses:. For a list of all supported codes, see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Display unsupported elements as literal characters by backslash-escaping them. E.g. 1\. Not an ordered list.

For accessibility reasons, you should never set an empty label (label="") but hide it with label_visibility if needed. In the future, we may disallow empty labels by raising an exception.

value (bool)

Preselect the toggle when it first renders. This will be cast to bool internally.

key (str or int)

An optional string or integer to use as the unique key for the widget. If this is omitted, a key will be generated for the widget based on its content. Multiple widgets of the same type may not share the same key.

help (str)

An optional tooltip that gets displayed next to the toggle.

on_change (callable)

An optional callback invoked when this toggle's value changes.

args (tuple)

An optional tuple of args to pass to the callback.

kwargs (dict)

An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback.

disabled (bool)

An optional boolean, which disables the toggle if set to True. The default is False.

label_visibility ("visible", "hidden", or "collapsed")

The visibility of the label. If "hidden", the label doesn't show but there is still empty space for it (equivalent to label=""). If "collapsed", both the label and the space are removed. Default is "visible".

Returns

(bool)

Whether or not the toggle is checked.

Example
import streamlit as st

on = st.toggle('Activate feature')

if on:
    st.write('Feature activated!')

Display a download button widget.

This is useful when you would like to provide a way for your users to download a file directly from your app.

Note that the data to be downloaded is stored in-memory while the user is connected, so it's a good idea to keep file sizes under a couple hundred megabytes to conserve memory.

Function signature
[source]

st.download_button(label, data, file_name=None, mime=None, key=None, help=None, on_click=None, args=None, kwargs=None, *, type="secondary", disabled=False, use_container_width=False)

Parameters

label (str)

A short label explaining to the user what this button is for. The label can optionally contain Markdown and supports the following elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, and Emojis.

This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1: and :sunglasses:. For a list of all supported codes, see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Display unsupported elements as literal characters by backslash-escaping them. E.g. 1\. Not an ordered list.

data (str or bytes or file)

The contents of the file to be downloaded. See example below for caching techniques to avoid recomputing this data unnecessarily.

file_name (str)

An optional string to use as the name of the file to be downloaded, such as 'my_file.csv'. If not specified, the name will be automatically generated.

mime (str or None)

The MIME type of the data. If None, defaults to "text/plain" (if data is of type str or is a textual file) or "application/octet-stream" (if data is of type bytes or is a binary file).

key (str or int)

An optional string or integer to use as the unique key for the widget. If this is omitted, a key will be generated for the widget based on its content. Multiple widgets of the same type may not share the same key.

help (str)

An optional tooltip that gets displayed when the button is hovered over.

on_click (callable)

An optional callback invoked when this button is clicked.

args (tuple)

An optional tuple of args to pass to the callback.

kwargs (dict)

An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback.

type ("secondary" or "primary")

An optional string that specifies the button type. Can be "primary" for a button with additional emphasis or "secondary" for a normal button. Defaults to "secondary".

disabled (bool)

An optional boolean, which disables the download button if set to True. The default is False.

use_container_width (bool)

An optional boolean, which makes the button stretch its width to match the parent container.

Returns

(bool)

True if the button was clicked on the last run of the app, False otherwise.

Examples

Download a large DataFrame as a CSV:

import streamlit as st

@st.cache
def convert_df(df):
    # IMPORTANT: Cache the conversion to prevent computation on every rerun
    return df.to_csv().encode('utf-8')

csv = convert_df(my_large_df)

st.download_button(
    label="Download data as CSV",
    data=csv,
    file_name='large_df.csv',
    mime='text/csv',
)
Copy

Download a string as a file:

import streamlit as st

text_contents = '''This is some text'''
st.download_button('Download some text', text_contents)
Copy

Download a binary file:

import streamlit as st

binary_contents = b'example content'
# Defaults to 'application/octet-stream'
st.download_button('Download binary file', binary_contents)
Copy

Download an image:

import streamlit as st

with open("flower.png", "rb") as file:
    btn = st.download_button(
            label="Download image",
            data=file,
            file_name="flower.png",

Display a chart using the Altair library.

Function signature
[source]

st.altair_chart(altair_chart, use_container_width=False, theme="streamlit")

Parameters

altair_chart (altair.Chart)

The Altair chart object to display.

use_container_width (bool)

If True, set the chart width to the column width. This takes precedence over Altair's native width value.

theme ("streamlit" or None)

The theme of the chart. Currently, we only support "streamlit" for the Streamlit defined design or None to fallback to the default behavior of the library.

Example
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import altair as alt

chart_data = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(20, 3), columns=["a", "b", "c"])

c = (
   alt.Chart(chart_data)
   .mark_circle()
   .encode(x="a", y="b", size="c", color="c", tooltip=["a", "b", "c"])
)

st.altair_chart(c, use_container_width=True)
Copy

Examples of Altair charts can be found at https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/.

Theming

Altair charts are displayed using the Streamlit theme by default. This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.

The Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the theme="streamlit" keyword argument. To disable it, and use Altair's native theme, use theme=None instead.

Let's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Altair theme:

import altair as alt
from vega_datasets import data

source = data.cars()

chart = alt.Chart(source).mark_circle().encode(
    x='Horsepower',
    y='Miles_per_Gallon',
    color='Origin',
).interactive()

tab1, tab2 = st.tabs(["Streamlit theme (default)", "Altair native theme"])

with tab1:
    # Use the Streamlit theme.
    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.
    st.altair_chart(chart, theme="streamlit", use_container_width=True)
with tab2:
    # Use the native Altair theme.
    st.altair_chart(chart, theme=None, use_container_width=True)


Click the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.

If you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!

Here's an example of an Altair chart where manual color passing is done and reflected:

See the code
expand_more

Notice how the custom colors are still reflected in the chart, even when the Streamlit theme is enabled üëá

For many more examples of Altair charts with and without the Streamlit theme, check out the altair.streamlit.app.

Annotating charts

Altair also allows you to annotate your charts with text, images, and emojis. You can do this by creating layered charts, which let you overlay two different charts on top of each other. The idea is to use the first chart to show the data, and the second chart to show the annotations. The second chart can then be overlaid on top of the first chart using the + operator to create a layered chart.

Let's walk through an example of annotating a time-series chart with text and an emoji.

Step 1: Create the base chart

In this example, we create a time-series chart to track the evolution of stock prices. The chart is interactive and contains a multi-line tooltip. Click here to learn more about multi-line tooltips in Altair.

First, we import the required libraries and load the example stocks dataset using the vega_datasets package:

import altair as alt
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
from vega_datasets import data

# We use @st.cache_data to keep the dataset in cache
@st.cache_data
def get_data():
    source = data.stocks()
    source = source[source.date.gt("2004-01-01")]
    return source

source = get_data()


Next, we define a function get_chart() to create the interactive time-series chart of the stock prices with a multi-line tooltip. The x-axis represents the date, and the y-axis represents the stock price.

We then invoke get_chart() that takes the stock prices dataframe as an input and returns a chart object. This is going to be our base chart on which we will overlay the annotations in Step 2.

# Define the base time-series chart.
def get_chart(data):
    hover = alt.selection_single(
        fields=["date"],
        nearest=True,
        on="mouseover",
        empty="none",
    )

    lines = (
        alt.Chart(data, title="Evolution of stock prices")
        .mark_line()
        .encode(
            x="date",
            y="price",
            color="symbol",
        )
    )

    # Draw points on the line, and highlight based on selection
    points = lines.transform_filter(hover).mark_circle(size=65)

    # Draw a rule at the location of the selection
    tooltips = (
        alt.Chart(data)
        .mark_rule()
        .encode(
            x="yearmonthdate(date)",
            y="price",
            opacity=alt.condition(hover, alt.value(0.3), alt.value(0)),
            tooltip=[
                alt.Tooltip("date", title="Date"),
                alt.Tooltip("price", title="Price (USD)"),
            ],
        )
        .add_selection(hover)
    )
    return (lines + points + tooltips).interactive()

chart = get_chart(source)

Step 2: Annotate the chart

Now that we have our first chart that shows the data, we can annotate it with text and an emoji. Let's overlay the ‚¨á emoji on top of the time-series chart at specifc points of interest. We want users to hover over the ‚¨á emoji to see the associated annotation text.

For simplicity, let's annotate four specific dates and set the height of the annotations at constant value of 10.

star
Tip

You can vary the horizontal and vertical postions of the annotations by replacing the hard-coded values with the output of Streamlit widgets! Click here to jump to a live example below, and develop an intuition for the ideal horizontal and vertical positions of the annotations by playing with Streamlit widgets.

To do so, we create a dataframe annotations_df containing the dates, annotation text, and the height of the annotations:

# Add annotations
ANNOTATIONS = [
    ("Mar 01, 2008", "Pretty good day for GOOG"),
    ("Dec 01, 2007", "Something's going wrong for GOOG & AAPL"),
    ("Nov 01, 2008", "Market starts again thanks to..."),
    ("Dec 01, 2009", "Small crash for GOOG after..."),
]
annotations_df = pd.DataFrame(ANNOTATIONS, columns=["date", "event"])
annotations_df.date = pd.to_datetime(annotations_df.date)
annotations_df["y"] = 10


Using this dataframe, we create a scatter plot with the x-axis representing the date, and the y-axis representing the height of the annotation. The data point at the specific date and height is represented by the ‚¨á emoji, using Altair's mark_text() mark.

The annotation text is displayed as a tooltip when users hover over the ‚¨á emoji. This is achieved using Altair's encode() method to map the event column containing the annotation text to the visual attribute ‚¨á of the plot.

annotation_layer = (
    alt.Chart(annotations_df)
    .mark_text(size=20, text="‚¨á", dx=-8, dy=-10, align="left")
    .encode(
        x="date:T",
        y=alt.Y("y:Q"),
        tooltip=["event"],
    )
    .interactive()
)


Finally, we overlay the annotations on top of the base chart using the + operator to create the final layered chart! üéà

st.altair_chart(
    (chart + annotation_layer).interactive(),
    use_container_width=True
)


To use images instead of emojis, replace the line containing .mark_text() with .mark_image(), and replace image_url below with the URL of the image:

.mark_image(
    width=12,
    height=12,
    url="image_url",
)

Interactive example

Now that you've learned how to annotate charts, the sky's the limit! We've extended the above example to let you interactively paste your favorite emoji and set its position on the chart with Streamlit widgets. üëá

Display a chart using the Vega-Lite library.

Function signature
[source]

st.vega_lite_chart(data=None, spec=None, use_container_width=False, theme="streamlit", **kwargs)

Parameters

data (pandas.DataFrame, pandas.Styler, pyarrow.Table, numpy.ndarray, Iterable, dict, or None)

Either the data to be plotted or a Vega-Lite spec containing the data (which more closely follows the Vega-Lite API).

spec (dict or None)

The Vega-Lite spec for the chart. If the spec was already passed in the previous argument, this must be set to None. See https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/ for more info.

use_container_width (bool)

If True, set the chart width to the column width. This takes precedence over Vega-Lite's native width value.

theme ("streamlit" or None)

The theme of the chart. Currently, we only support "streamlit" for the Streamlit defined design or None to fallback to the default behavior of the library.

**kwargs (any)

Same as spec, but as keywords.

Example
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

chart_data = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(200, 3), columns=["a", "b", "c"])

st.vega_lite_chart(
   chart_data,
   {
       "mark": {"type": "circle", "tooltip": True},
       "encoding": {
           "x": {"field": "a", "type": "quantitative"},
           "y": {"field": "b", "type": "quantitative"},
           "size": {"field": "c", "type": "quantitative"},
           "color": {"field": "c", "type": "quantitative"},
       },
   },
)
Copy

Examples of Vega-Lite usage without Streamlit can be found at https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/. Most of those can be easily translated to the syntax shown above.

Theming

Vega-Lite charts are displayed using the Streamlit theme by default. This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.

The Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the theme="streamlit" keyword argument. To disable it, and use Vega-Lite's native theme, use theme=None instead.

Let's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Vega-Lite theme:

import streamlit as st
from vega_datasets import data

source = data.cars()

chart = {
    "mark": "point",
    "encoding": {
        "x": {
            "field": "Horsepower",
            "type": "quantitative",
        },
        "y": {
            "field": "Miles_per_Gallon",
            "type": "quantitative",
        },
        "color": {"field": "Origin", "type": "nominal"},
        "shape": {"field": "Origin", "type": "nominal"},
    },
}

tab1, tab2 = st.tabs(["Streamlit theme (default)", "Vega-Lite native theme"])

with tab1:
    # Use the Streamlit theme.
    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.
    st.vega_lite_chart(
        source, chart, theme="streamlit", use_container_width=True
    )
with tab2:
    st.vega_lite_chart(
        source, chart, theme=None, use_container_width=True
    )


Click the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.

If you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!

Display a checkbox widget.

Function signature
[source]

st.checkbox(label, value=False, key=None, help=None, on_change=None, args=None, kwargs=None, *, disabled=False, label_visibility="visible")

Parameters

label (str)

A short label explaining to the user what this checkbox is for. The label can optionally contain Markdown and supports the following elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, Emojis, and Links.

This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1: and :sunglasses:. For a list of all supported codes, see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Display unsupported elements as literal characters by backslash-escaping them. E.g. 1\. Not an ordered list.

For accessibility reasons, you should never set an empty label (label="") but hide it with label_visibility if needed. In the future, we may disallow empty labels by raising an exception.

value (bool)

Preselect the checkbox when it first renders. This will be cast to bool internally.

key (str or int)

An optional string or integer to use as the unique key for the widget. If this is omitted, a key will be generated for the widget based on its content. Multiple widgets of the same type may not share the same key.

help (str)

An optional tooltip that gets displayed next to the checkbox.

on_change (callable)

An optional callback invoked when this checkbox's value changes.

args (tuple)

An optional tuple of args to pass to the callback.

kwargs (dict)

An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback.

disabled (bool)

An optional boolean, which disables the checkbox if set to True. The default is False.

label_visibility ("visible", "hidden", or "collapsed")

The visibility of the label. If "hidden", the label doesn't show but there is still empty space for it (equivalent to label=""). If "collapsed", both the label and the space are removed. Default is "visible".

Returns

(bool)

Whether or not the checkbox is checked.

Example
import streamlit as st

agree = st.checkbox('I agree')

if agree:
    st.write('Great!')

Display a data editor widget.

The data editor widget allows you to edit dataframes and many other data structures in a table-like UI.

Warning

When going from st.experimental_data_editor to st.data_editor in 1.23.0, the data editor's representation in st.session_state was changed. The edited_cells dictionary is now called edited_rows and uses a different format ({0: {"column name": "edited value"}} instead of {"0:1": "edited value"}). You may need to adjust the code if your app uses st.experimental_data_editor in combination with st.session_state."

Function signature
[source]

st.data_editor(data, *, width=None, height=None, use_container_width=False, hide_index=None, column_order=None, column_config=None, num_rows="fixed", disabled=False, key=None, on_change=None, args=None, kwargs=None)

Parameters

data (pandas.DataFrame, pandas.Series, pandas.Styler, pandas.Index, pyarrow.Table, numpy.ndarray, pyspark.sql.DataFrame, snowflake.snowpark.DataFrame, list, set, tuple, dict, or None)

The data to edit in the data editor.

Note

Styles from pandas.Styler will only be applied to non-editable columns.
Mixing data types within a column can make the column uneditable.
Additionally, the following data types are not yet supported for editing: complex, list, tuple, bytes, bytearray, memoryview, dict, set, frozenset, fractions.Fraction, pandas.Interval, and pandas.Period.
To prevent overflow in JavaScript, columns containing datetime.timedelta and pandas.Timedelta values will default to uneditable but this can be changed through column configuration.

width (int or None)

Desired width of the data editor expressed in pixels. If None, the width will be automatically determined.

height (int or None)

Desired height of the data editor expressed in pixels. If None, the height will be automatically determined.

use_container_width (bool)

If True, set the data editor width to the width of the parent container. This takes precedence over the width argument. Defaults to False.

hide_index (bool or None)

Whether to hide the index column(s). If None (default), the visibility of index columns is automatically determined based on the data.

column_order (Iterable of str or None)

Specifies the display order of columns. This also affects which columns are visible. For example, column_order=("col2", "col1") will display 'col2' first, followed by 'col1', and will hide all other non-index columns. If None (default), the order is inherited from the original data structure.

column_config (dict or None)

Configures how columns are displayed, e.g. their title, visibility, type, or format, as well as editing properties such as min/max value or step. This needs to be a dictionary where each key is a column name and the value is one of:

None to hide the column.
A string to set the display label of the column.
One of the column types defined under st.column_config, e.g. st.column_config.NumberColumn("Dollar values‚Äù, format=‚Äù$ %d") to show a column as dollar amounts. See more info on the available column types and config options here.

To configure the index column(s), use _index as the column name.

num_rows ("fixed" or "dynamic")

Specifies if the user can add and delete rows in the data editor. If "fixed", the user cannot add or delete rows. If "dynamic", the user can add and delete rows in the data editor, but column sorting is disabled. Defaults to "fixed".

disabled (bool or Iterable of str)

Controls the editing of columns. If True, editing is disabled for all columns. If an Iterable of column names is provided (e.g., disabled=("col1", "col2")), only the specified columns will be disabled for editing. If False (default), all columns that support editing are editable.

key (str)

An optional string to use as the unique key for this widget. If this is omitted, a key will be generated for the widget based on its content. Multiple widgets of the same type may not share the same key.

on_change (callable)

An optional callback invoked when this data_editor's value changes.

args (tuple)

An optional tuple of args to pass to the callback.

kwargs (dict)

An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback.

Returns

(pandas.DataFrame, pandas.Series, pyarrow.Table, numpy.ndarray, list, set, tuple, or dict.)

The edited data. The edited data is returned in its original data type if it corresponds to any of the supported return types. All other data types are returned as a pandas.DataFrame.

Examples
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(
    [
       {"command": "st.selectbox", "rating": 4, "is_widget": True},
       {"command": "st.balloons", "rating": 5, "is_widget": False},
       {"command": "st.time_input", "rating": 3, "is_widget": True},
   ]
)
edited_df = st.data_editor(df)

favorite_command = edited_df.loc[edited_df["rating"].idxmax()]["command"]
st.markdown(f"Your favorite command is **{favorite_command}** üéà")
Copy

You can also allow the user to add and delete rows by setting num_rows to "dynamic":

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(
    [
       {"command": "st.selectbox", "rating": 4, "is_widget": True},
       {"command": "st.balloons", "rating": 5, "is_widget": False},
       {"command": "st.time_input", "rating": 3, "is_widget": True},
   ]
)
edited_df = st.data_editor(df, num_rows="dynamic")

favorite_command = edited_df.loc[edited_df["rating"].idxmax()]["command"]
st.markdown(f"Your favorite command is **{favorite_command}** üéà")
Copy

Or you can customize the data editor via column_config, hide_index, column_order, or disabled:

import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

df = pd.DataFrame(
    [
        {"command": "st.selectbox", "rating": 4, "is_widget": True},
        {"command": "st.balloons", "rating": 5, "is_widget": False},
        {"command": "st.time_input", "rating": 3, "is_widget": True},
    ]
)
edited_df = st.data_editor(
    df,
    column_config={
        "command": "Streamlit Command",
        "rating": st.column_config.NumberColumn(
            "Your rating",
            help="How much do you like this command (1-5)?",
            min_value=1,
            max_value=5,
            step=1,
            format="%d ‚≠ê",
        ),
        "is_widget": "Widget ?",
    },
    disabled=["command", "is_widget"],
    hide_index=True,
)

favorite_command = edited_df.loc[edited_df["rating"].idxmax()]["command"]
st.markdown(f"Your favorite command is **{favorite_command}** üéà")
Copy
Configuring columns

You can configure the display and editing behavior of columns in st.dataframe and st.data_editor via the Column configuration API. We have developed the API to let you add images, charts, and clickable URLs in dataframe and data editor columns. Additionally, you can make individual columns editable, set columns as categorical and specify which options they can take, hide the index of the dataframe, and much more.

Or you can render the chart from the graph using GraphViz's Dot language:

st.graphviz_chart('''
    digraph {
        run -> intr
        intr -> runbl
        runbl -> run
        run -> kernel

        kernel -> sleep
        kernel -> runmem
        sleep -> swap
        swap -> runswap
        runswap -> new
        runswap -> runmem
        new -> runmem
        sleep -> runmem
    }
''')

Display a button widget.

Function signature
[source]

st.button(label, key=None, help=None, on_click=None, args=None, kwargs=None, *, type="secondary", disabled=False, use_container_width=False)

Parameters

label (str)

A short label explaining to the user what this button is for. The label can optionally contain Markdown and supports the following elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, and Emojis.

This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1: and :sunglasses:. For a list of all supported codes, see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Display unsupported elements as literal characters by backslash-escaping them. E.g. 1\. Not an ordered list.

key (str or int)

An optional string or integer to use as the unique key for the widget. If this is omitted, a key will be generated for the widget based on its content. Multiple widgets of the same type may not share the same key.

help (str)

An optional tooltip that gets displayed when the button is hovered over.

on_click (callable)

An optional callback invoked when this button is clicked.

args (tuple)

An optional tuple of args to pass to the callback.

kwargs (dict)

An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback.

type ("secondary" or "primary")

An optional string that specifies the button type. Can be "primary" for a button with additional emphasis or "secondary" for a normal button. Defaults to "secondary".

disabled (bool)

An optional boolean, which disables the button if set to True. The default is False.

use_container_width (bool)

An optional boolean, which makes the button stretch its width to match the parent container.

Returns

(bool)

True if the button was clicked on the last run of the app, False otherwise.

Example
import streamlit as st

st.button("Reset", type="primary")
if st.button('Say hello'):
    st.write('Why hello there')
else:
    st.write('Goodbye')
Copy
Advanced functionality

Although a button is the simplest of input widgets, it's very common for buttons to be deeply tied to the use of st.session_state. Check out our advanced guide on Button behavior and examples.

Featured videos

Check out our video on how to use one of Streamlit's core functions, the button!

In the video below, we'll take it a step further and learn how to combine a button, checkbox and radio button!

Display an interactive Bokeh chart.

Bokeh is a charting library for Python. The arguments to this function closely follow the ones for Bokeh's show function. You can find more about Bokeh at https://bokeh.pydata.org.

To show Bokeh charts in Streamlit, call st.bokeh_chart wherever you would call Bokeh's show.

Function signature
[source]

st.bokeh_chart(figure, use_container_width=False)

Parameters

figure (bokeh.plotting.figure.Figure)

A Bokeh figure to plot.

use_container_width (bool)

If True, set the chart width to the column width. This takes precedence over Bokeh's native width value.

Example
import streamlit as st
from bokeh.plotting import figure

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [6, 7, 2, 4, 5]

p = figure(
    title='simple line example',
    x_axis_label='x',
    y_axis_label='y')

p.line(x, y, legend_label='Trend', line_width=2)

st.bokeh_chart(p, use_container_width=True)

Draw a chart using the PyDeck library.

This supports 3D maps, point clouds, and more! More info about PyDeck at https://deckgl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

These docs are also quite useful:

DeckGL docs: https://github.com/uber/deck.gl/tree/master/docs
DeckGL JSON docs: https://github.com/uber/deck.gl/tree/master/modules/json

When using this command, Mapbox provides the map tiles to render map content. Note that Mapbox is a third-party product, the use of which is governed by Mapbox's Terms of Use.

Mapbox requires users to register and provide a token before users can request map tiles. Currently, Streamlit provides this token for you, but this could change at any time. We strongly recommend all users create and use their own personal Mapbox token to avoid any disruptions to their experience. You can do this with the mapbox.token config option.

To get a token for yourself, create an account at https://mapbox.com. For more info on how to set config options, see https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/configuration

Function signature
[source]

st.pydeck_chart(pydeck_obj=None, use_container_width=False)

Parameters

pydeck_obj (pydeck.Deck or None)

Object specifying the PyDeck chart to draw.

use_container_width (bool)

No description

Example

Here's a chart using a HexagonLayer and a ScatterplotLayer. It uses either the light or dark map style, based on which Streamlit theme is currently active:

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import pydeck as pdk

chart_data = pd.DataFrame(
   np.random.randn(1000, 2) / [50, 50] + [37.76, -122.4],
   columns=['lat', 'lon'])

st.pydeck_chart(pdk.Deck(
    map_style=None,
    initial_view_state=pdk.ViewState(
        latitude=37.76,
        longitude=-122.4,
        zoom=11,
        pitch=50,
    ),
    layers=[
        pdk.Layer(
           'HexagonLayer',
           data=chart_data,
           get_position='[lon, lat]',
           radius=200,
           elevation_scale=4,
           elevation_range=[0, 1000],
           pickable=True,
           extruded=True,
        ),
        pdk.Layer(
            'ScatterplotLayer',
            data=chart_data,
            get_position='[lon, lat]',
            get_color='[200, 30, 0, 160]',
            get_radius=200,
        ),
    ],
))
Copy

Note

To make the PyDeck chart's style consistent with Streamlit's theme, you can set map_style=None in the pydeck.Deck object.

Display a map with a scatterplot overlaid onto it.

This is a wrapper around st.pydeck_chart to quickly create scatterplot charts on top of a map, with auto-centering and auto-zoom.

When using this command, Mapbox provides the map tiles to render map content. Note that Mapbox is a third-party product, the use of which is governed by Mapbox's Terms of Use.

Mapbox requires users to register and provide a token before users can request map tiles. Currently, Streamlit provides this token for you, but this could change at any time. We strongly recommend all users create and use their own personal Mapbox token to avoid any disruptions to their experience. You can do this with the mapbox.token config option.

To get a token for yourself, create an account at https://mapbox.com. For more info on how to set config options, see https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/configuration

Function signature
[source]

st.map(data=None, *, latitude=None, longitude=None, color=None, size=None, zoom=None, use_container_width=True)

Parameters

data (pandas.DataFrame, pandas.Styler, pyarrow.Table, pyspark.sql.DataFrame, snowflake.snowpark.dataframe.DataFrame, snowflake.snowpark.table.Table, Iterable, dict, or None)

The data to be plotted.

latitude (str or None)

The name of the column containing the latitude coordinates of the datapoints in the chart.

If None, the latitude data will come from any column named 'lat', 'latitude', 'LAT', or 'LATITUDE'.

longitude (str or None)

The name of the column containing the longitude coordinates of the datapoints in the chart.

If None, the longitude data will come from any column named 'lon', 'longitude', 'LON', or 'LONGITUDE'.

color (str or tuple or None)

The color of the circles representing each datapoint.

Can be:

None, to use the default color.
A hex string like "#ffaa00" or "#ffaa0088".
An RGB or RGBA tuple with the red, green, blue, and alpha components specified as ints from 0 to 255 or floats from 0.0 to 1.0.
The name of the column to use for the color. Cells in this column should contain colors represented as a hex string or color tuple, as described above.

size (str or float or None)

The size of the circles representing each point, in meters.

This can be:

None, to use the default size.
A number like 100, to specify a single size to use for all datapoints.
The name of the column to use for the size. This allows each datapoint to be represented by a circle of a different size.

zoom (int)

Zoom level as specified in https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Zoom_levels.

use_container_width (bool)

If True, set the chart width to the column width. This takes precedence over the width argument.

Examples
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.DataFrame(
    np.random.randn(1000, 2) / [50, 50] + [37.76, -122.4],
    columns=['lat', 'lon'])

st.map(df)
Copy

You can also customize the size and color of the datapoints:

st.map(df, size=20, color='#0044ff')
Copy

And finally, you can choose different columns to use for the latitude and longitude components, as well as set size and color of each datapoint dynamically based on other columns:

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "col1": np.random.randn(1000) / 50 + 37.76,
    "col2": np.random.randn(1000) / 50 + -122.4,
    "col3": np.random.randn(1000) * 100,
    "col4": np.random.rand(1000, 4).tolist(),
})

st.map(df,
    latitude='col1',
    longitude='col2',
    size='col3',
    color='col4')
Copy

Display an interactive Plotly chart.

Plotly is a charting library for Python. The arguments to this function closely follow the ones for Plotly's plot() function. You can find more about Plotly at https://plot.ly/python.

To show Plotly charts in Streamlit, call st.plotly_chart wherever you would call Plotly's py.plot or py.iplot.

Function signature
[source]

st.plotly_chart(figure_or_data, use_container_width=False, sharing="streamlit", theme="streamlit", **kwargs)

Parameters

figure_or_data (plotly.graph_objs.Figure, plotly.graph_objs.Data, dict/list of plotly.graph_objs.Figure/Data)

See https://plot.ly/python/ for examples of graph descriptions.

use_container_width (bool)

If True, set the chart width to the column width. This takes precedence over the figure's native width value.

sharing ("streamlit", "private", "secret", or "public")

Use "streamlit" to insert the plot and all its dependencies directly in the Streamlit app using plotly's offline mode (default). Use any other sharing mode to send the chart to Plotly chart studio, which requires an account. See https://plot.ly/python/chart-studio/ for more information.

theme ("streamlit" or None)

The theme of the chart. Currently, we only support "streamlit" for the Streamlit defined design or None to fallback to the default behavior of the library.

**kwargs (null)

Any argument accepted by Plotly's plot() function.

Example

The example below comes straight from the examples at https://plot.ly/python:

import streamlit as st
import numpy as np
import plotly.figure_factory as ff

# Add histogram data
x1 = np.random.randn(200) - 2
x2 = np.random.randn(200)
x3 = np.random.randn(200) + 2

# Group data together
hist_data = [x1, x2, x3]

group_labels = ['Group 1', 'Group 2', 'Group 3']

# Create distplot with custom bin_size
fig = ff.create_distplot(
        hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[.1, .25, .5])

# Plot!
st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)

Plotly charts are displayed using the Streamlit theme by default. This theme is sleek, user-friendly, and incorporates Streamlit's color palette. The added benefit is that your charts better integrate with the rest of your app's design.

The Streamlit theme is available from Streamlit 1.16.0 through the theme="streamlit" keyword argument. To disable it, and use Plotly's native theme, use theme=None instead.

Let's look at an example of charts with the Streamlit theme and the native Plotly theme:

import plotly.express as px
import streamlit as st

df = px.data.gapminder()

fig = px.scatter(
    df.query("year==2007"),
    x="gdpPercap",
    y="lifeExp",
    size="pop",
    color="continent",
    hover_name="country",
    log_x=True,
    size_max=60,
)

tab1, tab2 = st.tabs(["Streamlit theme (default)", "Plotly native theme"])
with tab1:
    # Use the Streamlit theme.
    # This is the default. So you can also omit the theme argument.
    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme="streamlit", use_container_width=True)
with tab2:
    # Use the native Plotly theme.
    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)


Click the tabs in the interactive app below to see the charts with the Streamlit theme enabled and disabled.

If you're wondering if your own customizations will still be taken into account, don't worry! You can still make changes to your chart configurations. In other words, although we now enable the Streamlit theme by default, you can overwrite it with custom colors or fonts. For example, if you want a chart line to be green instead of the default red, you can do it!

Here's an example of an Plotly chart where a custom color scale is defined and reflected:

import plotly.express as px
import streamlit as st

st.subheader("Define a custom colorscale")
df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(
    df,
    x="sepal_width",
    y="sepal_length",
    color="sepal_length",
    color_continuous_scale="reds",
)

tab1, tab2 = st.tabs(["Streamlit theme (default)", "Plotly native theme"])
with tab1:
    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme="streamlit", use_container_width=True)
with tab2:
    st.plotly_chart(fig, theme=None, use_container_width=True)


Notice how the custom color scale is still reflected in the chart, even when the Streamlit theme is enabled üëá

For many more examples of Plotly charts with and without the Streamlit theme, check out the plotly.streamlit.app.

Display an area chart.

This is syntax-sugar around st.altair_chart. The main difference is this command uses the data's own column and indices to figure out the chart's spec. As a result this is easier to use for many "just plot this" scenarios, while being less customizable.

If st.area_chart does not guess the data specification correctly, try specifying your desired chart using st.altair_chart.

Function signature
[source]

st.area_chart(data=None, *, x=None, y=None, color=None, width=0, height=0, use_container_width=True)

Parameters

data (pandas.DataFrame, pandas.Styler, pyarrow.Table, numpy.ndarray, pyspark.sql.DataFrame, snowflake.snowpark.dataframe.DataFrame, snowflake.snowpark.table.Table, Iterable, or dict)

Data to be plotted.

x (str or None)

Column name to use for the x-axis. If None, uses the data index for the x-axis.

y (str, Sequence of str, or None)

Column name(s) to use for the y-axis. If a Sequence of strings, draws several series on the same chart by melting your wide-format table into a long-format table behind the scenes. If None, draws the data of all remaining columns as data series.

color (str, tuple, Sequence of str, Sequence of tuple, or None)

The color to use for different series in this chart.

For an area chart with just 1 series, this can be:

None, to use the default color.
A hex string like "#ffaa00" or "#ffaa0088".
An RGB or RGBA tuple with the red, green, blue, and alpha components specified as ints from 0 to 255 or floats from 0.0 to 1.0.

For an area chart with multiple series, where the dataframe is in long format (that is, y is None or just one column), this can be:

None, to use the default colors.

The name of a column in the dataset. Data points will be grouped into series of the same color based on the value of this column. In addition, if the values in this column match one of the color formats above (hex string or color tuple), then that color will be used.

For example: if the dataset has 1000 rows, but this column only contains the values "adult", "child", and "baby", then those 1000 datapoints will be grouped into three series whose colors will be automatically selected from the default palette.

But, if for the same 1000-row dataset, this column contained the values "#ffaa00", "#f0f", "#0000ff", then then those 1000 datapoints would still be grouped into 3 series, but their colors would be "#ffaa00", "#f0f", "#0000ff" this time around.

For an area chart with multiple series, where the dataframe is in wide format (that is, y is a Sequence of columns), this can be:

None, to use the default colors.
A list of string colors or color tuples to be used for each of the series in the chart. This list should have the same length as the number of y values (e.g. color=["#fd0", "#f0f", "#04f"] for three lines).

width (int)

The chart width in pixels. If 0, selects the width automatically.

height (int)

The chart height in pixels. If 0, selects the height automatically.

use_container_width (bool)

If True, set the chart width to the column width. This takes precedence over the width argument.

Examples
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

chart_data = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(20, 3), columns=["a", "b", "c"])

st.area_chart(chart_data)
Copy

You can also choose different columns to use for x and y, as well as set the color dynamically based on a 3rd column (assuming your dataframe is in long format):

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

chart_data = pd.DataFrame(
   {
       "col1": np.random.randn(20),
       "col2": np.random.randn(20),
       "col3": np.random.choice(["A", "B", "C"], 20),
   }
)

st.area_chart(chart_data, x="col1", y="col2", color="col3")
Copy

Finally, if your dataframe is in wide format, you can group multiple columns under the y argument to show multiple series with different colors:

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

chart_data = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(20, 3), columns=["col1", "col2", "col3"])

st.area_chart(
   chart_data, x="col1", y=["col2", "col3"], color=["#FF0000", "#0000FF"]  # Optional
)
Copy

Display a scatterplot chart.

This is syntax-sugar around st.altair_chart. The main difference is this command uses the data's own column and indices to figure out the chart's spec. As a result this is easier to use for many "just plot this" scenarios, while being less customizable.

If st.scatter_chart does not guess the data specification correctly, try specifying your desired chart using st.altair_chart.

Function signature
[source]

st.scatter_chart(data=None, *, x=None, y=None, color=None, size=None, width=0, height=0, use_container_width=True)

Parameters

data (pandas.DataFrame, pandas.Styler, pyarrow.Table, numpy.ndarray, pyspark.sql.DataFrame, snowflake.snowpark.dataframe.DataFrame, snowflake.snowpark.table.Table, Iterable, dict or None)

Data to be plotted.

x (str or None)

Column name to use for the x-axis. If None, uses the data index for the x-axis.

y (str, Sequence of str, or None)

Column name(s) to use for the y-axis. If a Sequence of strings, draws several series on the same chart by melting your wide-format table into a long-format table behind the scenes. If None, draws the data of all remaining columns as data series.

color (str, tuple, Sequence of str, Sequence of tuple, or None)

The color of the circles representing each datapoint.

This can be:

None, to use the default color.

A hex string like "#ffaa00" or "#ffaa0088".

An RGB or RGBA tuple with the red, green, blue, and alpha components specified as ints from 0 to 255 or floats from 0.0 to 1.0.

The name of a column in the dataset where the color of that datapoint will come from.

If the values in this column are in one of the color formats above (hex string or color tuple), then that color will be used.

Otherwise, the color will be automatically picked from the default palette.

For example: if the dataset has 1000 rows, but this column only contains the values "adult", "child", and "baby", then those 1000 datapoints be shown using three colors from the default palette.

But if this column only contains floats or ints, then those 1000 datapoints will be shown using a colors from a continuous color gradient.

Finally, if this column only contains the values "#ffaa00", "#f0f", "#0000ff", then then each of those 1000 datapoints will be assigned "#ffaa00", "#f0f", or "#0000ff" as appropriate.

If the dataframe is in wide format (that is, y is a Sequence of columns), this can also be:

A list of string colors or color tuples to be used for each of the series in the chart. This list should have the same length as the number of y values (e.g. color=["#fd0", "#f0f", "#04f"] for three series).

size (str, float, int, or None)

The size of the circles representing each point.

This can be:

A number like 100, to specify a single size to use for all datapoints.
The name of the column to use for the size. This allows each datapoint to be represented by a circle of a different size.

width (int)

The chart width in pixels. If 0, selects the width automatically.

height (int)

The chart height in pixels. If 0, selects the height automatically.

use_container_width (bool)

If True, set the chart width to the column width. This takes precedence over the width argument.

Examples
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

chart_data = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(20, 3), columns=["a", "b", "c"])

st.scatter_chart(chart_data)
Copy

You can also choose different columns to use for x and y, as well as set the color dynamically based on a 3rd column (assuming your dataframe is in long format):

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

chart_data = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(20, 3), columns=["col1", "col2", "col3"])
chart_data['col4'] = np.random.choice(['A','B','C'], 20)

st.scatter_chart(
    chart_data,
    x='col1',
    y='col2',
    color='col4',
    size='col3',
)
Copy

Finally, if your dataframe is in wide format, you can group multiple columns under the y argument to show multiple series with different colors:

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

chart_data = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(20, 4), columns=["col1", "col2", "col3", "col4"])

st.scatter_chart(
    chart_data,
    x='col1',
    y=['col2', 'col3'],
    size='col4',
    color=['#FF0000', '#0000FF'],  # Optional

If st.bar_chart does not guess the data specification correctly, try specifying your desired chart using st.altair_chart.

Function signature
[source]

st.bar_chart(data=None, *, x=None, y=None, color=None, width=0, height=0, use_container_width=True)

Parameters

data (pandas.DataFrame, pandas.Styler, pyarrow.Table, numpy.ndarray, pyspark.sql.DataFrame, snowflake.snowpark.dataframe.DataFrame, snowflake.snowpark.table.Table, Iterable, or dict)

Data to be plotted.

x (str or None)

Column name to use for the x-axis. If None, uses the data index for the x-axis.

y (str, Sequence of str, or None)

Column name(s) to use for the y-axis. If a Sequence of strings, draws several series on the same chart by melting your wide-format table into a long-format table behind the scenes. If None, draws the data of all remaining columns as data series.

color (str, tuple, Sequence of str, Sequence of tuple, or None)

The color to use for different series in this chart.

For a bar chart with just one series, this can be:

None, to use the default color.
A hex string like "#ffaa00" or "#ffaa0088".
An RGB or RGBA tuple with the red, green, blue, and alpha components specified as ints from 0 to 255 or floats from 0.0 to 1.0.

For a bar chart with multiple series, where the dataframe is in long format (that is, y is None or just one column), this can be:

The name of a column in the dataset. Data points will be grouped into series of the same color based on the value of this column. In addition, if the values in this column match one of the color formats above (hex string or color tuple), then that color will be used.

For example: if the dataset has 1000 rows, but this column only contains the values "adult", "child", and "baby", then those 1000 datapoints will be grouped into three series whose colors will be automatically selected from the default palette.

A list of string colors or color tuples to be used for each of the series in the chart. This list should have the same length as the number of y values (e.g. color=["#fd0", "#f0f", "#04f"] for three lines).

width (int)

The chart width in pixels. If 0, selects the width automatically.

The chart height in pixels. If 0, selects the height automatically.

use_container_width (bool)

If True, set the chart width to the column width. This takes precedence over the width argument.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

chart_data = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(20, 3), columns=["a", "b", "c"])

st.bar_chart(chart_data)
Copy

You can also choose different columns to use for x and y, as well as set the color dynamically based on a 3rd column (assuming your dataframe is in long format):

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

chart_data = pd.DataFrame(
   {
       "col1": list(range(20)) * 3,
       "col2": np.random.randn(60),
       "col3": ["A"] * 20 + ["B"] * 20 + ["C"] * 20,
   }
)

st.bar_chart(chart_data, x="col1", y="col2", color="col3")
Copy

Finally, if your dataframe is in wide format, you can group multiple columns under the y argument to show multiple series with different colors:

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

chart_data = pd.DataFrame(
   {"col1": list(range(20)), "col2": np.random.randn(20), "col3": np.random.randn(20)}

Display a matplotlib.pyplot figure.

Function signature
[source]

st.pyplot(fig=None, clear_figure=None, use_container_width=True, **kwargs)

Parameters

fig (Matplotlib Figure)

The figure to plot. When this argument isn't specified, this function will render the global figure (but this is deprecated, as described below)

clear_figure (bool)

If True, the figure will be cleared after being rendered. If False, the figure will not be cleared after being rendered. If left unspecified, we pick a default based on the value of fig.

If fig is set, defaults to False.
If fig is not set, defaults to True. This simulates Jupyter's approach to matplotlib rendering.

use_container_width (bool)

If True, set the chart width to the column width. Defaults to True.

**kwargs (any)

Arguments to pass to Matplotlib's savefig function.

Example
import streamlit as st
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

arr = np.random.normal(1, 1, size=100)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(arr, bins=20)

st.pyplot(fig)
Copy
Notes

Note

Deprecation warning. After December 1st, 2020, we will remove the ability to specify no arguments in st.pyplot(), as that requires the use of Matplotlib's global figure object, which is not thread-safe. So please always pass a figure object as shown in the example section above.

Matplotlib supports several types of "backends". If you're getting an error using Matplotlib with Streamlit, try setting your backend to "TkAgg":

echo "backend: TkAgg" >> ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc
Copy

For more information, see https://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html.

Display a metric in big bold font, with an optional indicator of how the metric changed.

Tip: If you want to display a large number, it may be a good idea to shorten it using packages like millify or numerize. E.g. 1234 can be displayed as 1.2k using st.metric("Short number", millify(1234)).

Function signature
[source]

st.metric(label, value, delta=None, delta_color="normal", help=None, label_visibility="visible")

Parameters

label (str)

The header or title for the metric. The label can optionally contain Markdown and supports the following elements: Bold, Italics, Strikethroughs, Inline Code, Emojis, and Links.

This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1: and :sunglasses:. For a list of all supported codes, see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

Unsupported elements are unwrapped so only their children (text contents) render. Display unsupported elements as literal characters by backslash-escaping them. E.g. 1\. Not an ordered list.

value (int, float, str, or None)

Value of the metric. None is rendered as a long dash.

delta (int, float, str, or None)

Indicator of how the metric changed, rendered with an arrow below the metric. If delta is negative (int/float) or starts with a minus sign (str), the arrow points down and the text is red; else the arrow points up and the text is green. If None (default), no delta indicator is shown.

delta_color ("normal", "inverse", or "off")

If "normal" (default), the delta indicator is shown as described above. If "inverse", it is red when positive and green when negative. This is useful when a negative change is considered good, e.g. if cost decreased. If "off", delta is shown in gray regardless of its value.

help (str)

An optional tooltip that gets displayed next to the metric label.

label_visibility ("visible", "hidden", or "collapsed")

The visibility of the label. If "hidden", the label doesn't show but there is still empty space for it (equivalent to label=""). If "collapsed", both the label and the space are removed. Default is "visible".

Example
import streamlit as st

st.metric(label="Temperature", value="70 ¬∞F", delta="1.2 ¬∞F")
Copy

st.metric looks especially nice in combination with st.columns:

import streamlit as st

col1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)
col1.metric("Temperature", "70 ¬∞F", "1.2 ¬∞F")
col2.metric("Wind", "9 mph", "-8%")
col3.metric("Humidity", "86%", "4%")
Copy

The delta indicator color can also be inverted or turned off:

import streamlit as st

st.metric(label="Gas price", value=4, delta=-0.5,
    delta_color="inverse")

st.metric(label="Active developers", value=123, delta=123,
    delta_color="off")
Copy

Display a line chart.

This is syntax-sugar around st.altair_chart. The main difference is this command uses the data's own column and indices to figure out the chart's spec. As a result this is easier to use for many "just plot this" scenarios, while being less customizable.

If st.line_chart does not guess the data specification correctly, try specifying your desired chart using st.altair_chart.

Function signature
[source]

st.line_chart(data=None, *, x=None, y=None, color=None, width=0, height=0, use_container_width=True)

Parameters

data (pandas.DataFrame, pandas.Styler, pyarrow.Table, numpy.ndarray, pyspark.sql.DataFrame, snowflake.snowpark.dataframe.DataFrame, snowflake.snowpark.table.Table, Iterable, dict or None)

Data to be plotted.

x (str or None)

Column name to use for the x-axis. If None, uses the data index for the x-axis.

y (str, Sequence of str, or None)

Column name(s) to use for the y-axis. If a Sequence of strings, draws several series on the same chart by melting your wide-format table into a long-format table behind the scenes. If None, draws the data of all remaining columns as data series.

color (str, tuple, Sequence of str, Sequence of tuple, or None)

The color to use for different lines in this chart.

For a line chart with just one line, this can be:

None, to use the default color.
A hex string like "#ffaa00" or "#ffaa0088".
An RGB or RGBA tuple with the red, green, blue, and alpha components specified as ints from 0 to 255 or floats from 0.0 to 1.0.

For a line chart with multiple lines, where the dataframe is in long format (that is, y is None or just one column), this can be:

None, to use the default colors.

The name of a column in the dataset. Data points will be grouped into lines of the same color based on the value of this column. In addition, if the values in this column match one of the color formats above (hex string or color tuple), then that color will be used.

For example: if the dataset has 1000 rows, but this column only contains the values "adult", "child", and "baby", then those 1000 datapoints will be grouped into three lines whose colors will be automatically selected from the default palette.

But, if for the same 1000-row dataset, this column contained the values "#ffaa00", "#f0f", "#0000ff", then then those 1000 datapoints would still be grouped into three lines, but their colors would be "#ffaa00", "#f0f", "#0000ff" this time around.

For a line chart with multiple lines, where the dataframe is in wide format (that is, y is a Sequence of columns), this can be:

None, to use the default colors.
A list of string colors or color tuples to be used for each of the lines in the chart. This list should have the same length as the number of y values (e.g. color=["#fd0", "#f0f", "#04f"] for three lines).

width (int)

The chart width in pixels. If 0, selects the width automatically.

height (int)

The chart height in pixels. If 0, selects the height automatically.

use_container_width (bool)

If True, set the chart width to the column width. This takes precedence over the width argument.

Examples
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

chart_data = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(20, 3), columns=["a", "b", "c"])

st.line_chart(chart_data)
Copy

You can also choose different columns to use for x and y, as well as set the color dynamically based on a 3rd column (assuming your dataframe is in long format):

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

chart_data = pd.DataFrame(
   {
       "col1": np.random.randn(20),
       "col2": np.random.randn(20),
       "col3": np.random.choice(["A", "B", "C"], 20),
   }
)

st.line_chart(chart_data, x="col1", y="col2", color="col3")
Copy

Finally, if your dataframe is in wide format, you can group multiple columns under the y argument to show multiple lines with different colors:

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

chart_data = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(20, 3), columns=["col1", "col2", "col3"])

st.line_chart(
   chart_data, x="col1", y=["col2", "col3"], color=["#FF0000", "#0000FF"]  # Optional
)
Copy

Display a static table.

This differs from st.dataframe in that the table in this case is static: its entire contents are laid out directly on the page.

Function signature
[source]

st.table(data=None)

Parameters

data (pandas.DataFrame, pandas.Styler, pyarrow.Table, numpy.ndarray, pyspark.sql.DataFrame, snowflake.snowpark.dataframe.DataFrame, snowflake.snowpark.table.Table, Iterable, dict, or None)

The table data.

Example
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(10, 5), columns=("col %d" % i for i in range(5)))

st.table(df)

Streamlit in Snowflake

Display a dataframe as an interactive table.

This command works with dataframes from Pandas, PyArrow, Snowpark, and PySpark. It can also display several other types that can be converted to dataframes, e.g. numpy arrays, lists, sets and dictionaries.

Function signature
[source]

st.dataframe(data=None, width=None, height=None, *, use_container_width=False, hide_index=None, column_order=None, column_config=None)

Parameters

data (pandas.DataFrame, pandas.Series, pandas.Styler, pandas.Index, pyarrow.Table, numpy.ndarray, pyspark.sql.DataFrame, snowflake.snowpark.dataframe.DataFrame, snowflake.snowpark.table.Table, Iterable, dict, or None)

The data to display.

If 'data' is a pandas.Styler, it will be used to style its underlying DataFrame. Streamlit supports custom cell values and colors. It does not support some of the more exotic pandas styling features, like bar charts, hovering, and captions.

width (int or None)

Desired width of the dataframe expressed in pixels. If None, the width will be automatically calculated based on the column content.

height (int or None)

Desired height of the dataframe expressed in pixels. If None, a default height is used.

use_container_width (bool)

If True, set the dataframe width to the width of the parent container. This takes precedence over the width argument.

hide_index (bool or None)

Whether to hide the index column(s). If None (default), the visibility of index columns is automatically determined based on the data.

column_order (Iterable of str or None)

Specifies the display order of columns. This also affects which columns are visible. For example, column_order=("col2", "col1") will display 'col2' first, followed by 'col1', and will hide all other non-index columns. If None (default), the order is inherited from the original data structure.

column_config (dict or None)

Configures how columns are displayed, e.g. their title, visibility, type, or format. This needs to be a dictionary where each key is a column name and the value is one of:

None to hide the column.
A string to set the display label of the column.
One of the column types defined under st.column_config, e.g. st.column_config.NumberColumn("Dollar values‚Äù, format=‚Äù$ %d") to show a column as dollar amounts. See more info on the available column types and config options here.

To configure the index column(s), use _index as the column name.

Examples
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(50, 20), columns=("col %d" % i for i in range(20)))

st.dataframe(df)  # Same as st.write(df)
Copy

You can also pass a Pandas Styler object to change the style of the rendered DataFrame:

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(10, 20), columns=("col %d" % i for i in range(20)))

st.dataframe(df.style.highlight_max(axis=0))
Copy

Or you can customize the dataframe via column_config, hide_index, or column_order:

import random
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "name": ["Roadmap", "Extras", "Issues"],
        "url": ["https://roadmap.streamlit.app", "https://extras.streamlit.app", "https://issues.streamlit.app"],
        "stars": [random.randint(0, 1000) for _ in range(3)],
        "views_history": [[random.randint(0, 5000) for _ in range(30)] for _ in range(3)],
    }
)
st.dataframe(
    df,
    column_config={
        "name": "App name",
        "stars": st.column_config.NumberColumn(
            "Github Stars",
            help="Number of stars on GitHub",
            format="%d ‚≠ê",
        ),
        "url": st.column_config.LinkColumn("App URL"),
        "views_history": st.column_config.LineChartColumn(
            "Views (past 30 days)", y_min=0, y_max=5000
        ),
    },
    hide_index=True,
)
Copy



st.dataframe supports the use_container_width parameter to stretch across the full container width:

import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

# Cache the dataframe so it's only loaded once
@st.cache_data
def load_data():
    return pd.DataFrame(
        {
            "first column": [1, 2, 3, 4],
            "second column": [10, 20, 30, 40],
        }
    )

# Boolean to resize the dataframe, stored as a session state variable
st.checkbox("Use container width", value=False, key="use_container_width")

df = load_data()

# Display the dataframe and allow the user to stretch the dataframe
# across the full width of the container, based on the checkbox value
st.dataframe(df, use_container_width=st.session_state.use_container_width)

Interactivity

Dataframes displayed with st.dataframe are interactive. End users can sort, resize, search, and copy data to their clipboard. For on overview of features, read our Dataframes guide.

Configuring columns

You can configure the display and editing behavior of columns in st.dataframe and st.data_editor via the Column configuration API. We have developed the API to let you add images, charts, and clickable URLs in dataframe and data editor columns. Additionally, you can make individual columns editable, set columns as categorical and specify which options they can take, hide the index of the dataframe, and much more.

Streamlit in Snowflake

Display a data editor widget.

The data editor widget allows you to edit dataframes and many other data structures in a table-like UI.

Warning

When going from st.experimental_data_editor to st.data_editor in 1.23.0, the data editor's representation in st.session_state was changed. The edited_cells dictionary is now called edited_rows and uses a different format ({0: {"column name": "edited value"}} instead of {"0:1": "edited value"}). You may need to adjust the code if your app uses st.experimental_data_editor in combination with st.session_state."

Function signature
[source]

st.data_editor(data, *, width=None, height=None, use_container_width=False, hide_index=None, column_order=None, column_config=None, num_rows="fixed", disabled=False, key=None, on_change=None, args=None, kwargs=None)

Parameters

data (pandas.DataFrame, pandas.Series, pandas.Styler, pandas.Index, pyarrow.Table, numpy.ndarray, pyspark.sql.DataFrame, snowflake.snowpark.DataFrame, list, set, tuple, dict, or None)

The data to edit in the data editor.

Note

Styles from pandas.Styler will only be applied to non-editable columns.
Mixing data types within a column can make the column uneditable.
Additionally, the following data types are not yet supported for editing: complex, list, tuple, bytes, bytearray, memoryview, dict, set, frozenset, fractions.Fraction, pandas.Interval, and pandas.Period.
To prevent overflow in JavaScript, columns containing datetime.timedelta and pandas.Timedelta values will default to uneditable but this can be changed through column configuration.

width (int or None)

Desired width of the data editor expressed in pixels. If None, the width will be automatically determined.

height (int or None)

Desired height of the data editor expressed in pixels. If None, the height will be automatically determined.

use_container_width (bool)

If True, set the data editor width to the width of the parent container. This takes precedence over the width argument. Defaults to False.

hide_index (bool or None)

Whether to hide the index column(s). If None (default), the visibility of index columns is automatically determined based on the data.

column_order (Iterable of str or None)

Specifies the display order of columns. This also affects which columns are visible. For example, column_order=("col2", "col1") will display 'col2' first, followed by 'col1', and will hide all other non-index columns. If None (default), the order is inherited from the original data structure.

column_config (dict or None)

Configures how columns are displayed, e.g. their title, visibility, type, or format, as well as editing properties such as min/max value or step. This needs to be a dictionary where each key is a column name and the value is one of:

None to hide the column.
A string to set the display label of the column.
One of the column types defined under st.column_config, e.g. st.column_config.NumberColumn("Dollar values‚Äù, format=‚Äù$ %d") to show a column as dollar amounts. See more info on the available column types and config options here.

To configure the index column(s), use _index as the column name.

num_rows ("fixed" or "dynamic")

Specifies if the user can add and delete rows in the data editor. If "fixed", the user cannot add or delete rows. If "dynamic", the user can add and delete rows in the data editor, but column sorting is disabled. Defaults to "fixed".

disabled (bool or Iterable of str)

Controls the editing of columns. If True, editing is disabled for all columns. If an Iterable of column names is provided (e.g., disabled=("col1", "col2")), only the specified columns will be disabled for editing. If False (default), all columns that support editing are editable.

key (str)

An optional string to use as the unique key for this widget. If this is omitted, a key will be generated for the widget based on its content. Multiple widgets of the same type may not share the same key.

on_change (callable)

An optional callback invoked when this data_editor's value changes.

args (tuple)

An optional tuple of args to pass to the callback.

kwargs (dict)

An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback.

Returns

(pandas.DataFrame, pandas.Series, pyarrow.Table, numpy.ndarray, list, set, tuple, or dict.)

The edited data. The edited data is returned in its original data type if it corresponds to any of the supported return types. All other data types are returned as a pandas.DataFrame.

Examples
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(
    [
       {"command": "st.selectbox", "rating": 4, "is_widget": True},
       {"command": "st.balloons", "rating": 5, "is_widget": False},
       {"command": "st.time_input", "rating": 3, "is_widget": True},
   ]
)
edited_df = st.data_editor(df)

favorite_command = edited_df.loc[edited_df["rating"].idxmax()]["command"]
st.markdown(f"Your favorite command is **{favorite_command}** üéà")
Copy

You can also allow the user to add and delete rows by setting num_rows to "dynamic":

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(
    [
       {"command": "st.selectbox", "rating": 4, "is_widget": True},
       {"command": "st.balloons", "rating": 5, "is_widget": False},
       {"command": "st.time_input", "rating": 3, "is_widget": True},
   ]
)
edited_df = st.data_editor(df, num_rows="dynamic")

favorite_command = edited_df.loc[edited_df["rating"].idxmax()]["command"]
st.markdown(f"Your favorite command is **{favorite_command}** üéà")
Copy

Or you can customize the data editor via column_config, hide_index, column_order, or disabled:

import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

df = pd.DataFrame(
    [
        {"command": "st.selectbox", "rating": 4, "is_widget": True},
        {"command": "st.balloons", "rating": 5, "is_widget": False},
        {"command": "st.time_input", "rating": 3, "is_widget": True},
    ]
)
edited_df = st.data_editor(
    df,
    column_config={
        "command": "Streamlit Command",
        "rating": st.column_config.NumberColumn(
            "Your rating",
            help="How much do you like this command (1-5)?",
            min_value=1,
            max_value=5,
            step=1,
            format="%d ‚≠ê",
        ),
        "is_widget": "Widget ?",
    },
    disabled=["command", "is_widget"],
    hide_index=True,
)

favorite_command = edited_df.loc[edited_df["rating"].idxmax()]["command"]
st.markdown(f"Your favorite command is **{favorite_command}** üéà")
Copy
Configuring columns

You can configure the display and editing behavior of columns in st.dataframe and st.data_editor via the Column configuration API. We have developed the API to let you add images, charts, and clickable URLs in dataframe and data editor columns. Additionally, you can make individual columns editable, set columns as categorical and specify which options they can take, hide the index of the dataframe, and much more.

Streamlit in Snowflake

Write arguments to the app.

This is the Swiss Army knife of Streamlit commands: it does different things depending on what you throw at it. Unlike other Streamlit commands, write() has some unique properties:

You can pass in multiple arguments, all of which will be written.
Its behavior depends on the input types as follows.
It returns None, so its "slot" in the App cannot be reused.
Function signature
[source]

st.write(*args, unsafe_allow_html=False, **kwargs)

Parameters

*args (any)

One or many objects to print to the App.

Arguments are handled as follows:

write(string) : Prints the formatted Markdown string, with
support for LaTeX expression, emoji shortcodes, and colored text. See docs for st.markdown for more.
write(data_frame) : Displays the DataFrame as a table.
write(error) : Prints an exception specially.
write(func) : Displays information about a function.
write(module) : Displays information about the module.
write(class) : Displays information about a class.
write(dict) : Displays dict in an interactive widget.
write(mpl_fig) : Displays a Matplotlib figure.
write(altair) : Displays an Altair chart.
write(keras) : Displays a Keras model.
write(graphviz) : Displays a Graphviz graph.
write(plotly_fig) : Displays a Plotly figure.
write(bokeh_fig) : Displays a Bokeh figure.
write(sympy_expr) : Prints SymPy expression using LaTeX.
write(htmlable) : Prints _repr_html_() for the object if available.
write(obj) : Prints str(obj) if otherwise unknown.

unsafe_allow_html (bool)

This is a keyword-only argument that defaults to False.

By default, any HTML tags found in strings will be escaped and therefore treated as pure text. This behavior may be turned off by setting this argument to True.

That said, we strongly advise against it. It is hard to write secure HTML, so by using this argument you may be compromising your users' security. For more information, see:

https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/152

Example

Its basic use case is to draw Markdown-formatted text, whenever the input is a string:

import streamlit as st

st.write('Hello, *World!* :sunglasses:')
Copy

As mentioned earlier, st.write() also accepts other data formats, such as numbers, data frames, styled data frames, and assorted objects:

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

st.write(1234)
st.write(pd.DataFrame({
    'first column': [1, 2, 3, 4],
    'second column': [10, 20, 30, 40],
}))
Copy

Finally, you can pass in multiple arguments to do things like:

import streamlit as st

st.write('1 + 1 = ', 2)
st.write('Below is a DataFrame:', data_frame, 'Above is a dataframe.')
Copy

Oh, one more thing: st.write accepts chart objects too! For example:

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import altair as alt

df = pd.DataFrame(
    np.random.randn(200, 3),
    columns=['a', 'b', 'c'])

c = alt.Chart(df).mark_circle().encode(
    x='a', y='b', size='c', color='c', tooltip=['a', 'b', 'c'])

st.write(c)
Copy

Create a multipage app
CONTENTS
Motivation
Convert an existing app into a multipage app
Create the entrypoint file
Create multiple pages
Run the multipage app
Next steps
Create a multipage app

In Additional features, we introduced multipage apps, including how to define pages, structure and run multipage apps, and navigate between pages in the user interface. You can read more details in our guide to Multipage apps

In this guide, let‚Äôs put our understanding of multipage apps to use by converting the previous version of our streamlit hello app to a multipage app!

Motivation

Before Streamlit 1.10.0, the streamlit hello command was a large single-page app. As there was no support for multiple pages, we resorted to splitting the app's content using st.selectbox in the sidebar to choose what content to run. The content is comprised of three demos for plotting, mapping, and dataframes.

Here's what the code and single-page app looked like:

hello.py (üëà Toggle to expand)

Notice how large the file is! Each app ‚Äúpage" is written as a function, and the selectbox is used to pick which page to display. As our app grows, maintaining the code requires a lot of additional overhead. Moreover, we‚Äôre limited by the st.selectbox UI to choose which ‚Äúpage" to run, we cannot customize individual page titles with st.set_page_config, and we‚Äôre unable to navigate between pages using URLs.

Convert an existing app into a multipage app

Now that we've identified the limitations of a single-page app, what can we do about it? Armed with our knowledge from the previous section, we can convert the existing app to be a multipage app, of course! At a high level, we need to perform the following steps:

Create a new pages folder in the same folder where the ‚Äúentrypoint file" (hello.py) lives
Rename our entrypoint file to Hello.py , so that the title in the sidebar is capitalized
Create three new files inside of pages:
pages/1_üìà_Plotting_Demo.py
pages/2_üåç_Mapping_Demo.py
pages/3_üìä_DataFrame_Demo.py
Move the contents of the plotting_demo, mapping_demo, and data_frame_demo functions into their corresponding new files from Step 3
Run streamlit run Hello.py to view your newly converted multipage app!

Now, let‚Äôs walk through each step of the process and view the corresponding changes in code.

Create the entrypoint file
Hello.py
import streamlit as st

st.set_page_config(
    page_title="Hello",
    page_icon="üëã",
)

st.write("# Welcome to Streamlit! üëã")

st.sidebar.success("Select a demo above.")

st.markdown(
    """
    Streamlit is an open-source app framework built specifically for
    Machine Learning and Data Science projects.
    **üëà Select a demo from the sidebar** to see some examples
    of what Streamlit can do!
    ### Want to learn more?
    - Check out [streamlit.io](https://streamlit.io)
    - Jump into our [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io)
    - Ask a question in our [community
        forums](https://discuss.streamlit.io)
    ### See more complex demos
    - Use a neural net to [analyze the Udacity Self-driving Car Image
        Dataset](https://github.com/streamlit/demo-self-driving)
    - Explore a [New York City rideshare dataset](https://github.com/streamlit/demo-uber-nyc-pickups)
"""
)




We rename our entrypoint file to Hello.py , so that the title in the sidebar is capitalized and only the code for the intro page is included. Additionally, we‚Äôre able to customize the page title and favicon ‚Äî as it appears in the browser tab with st.set_page_config. We can do so for each of our pages too!

Notice how the sidebar does not contain page labels as we haven‚Äôt created any pages yet.

Create multiple pages

A few things to remember here:

We can change the ordering of pages in our MPA by adding numbers to the beginning of each Python file. If we add a 1 to the front of our file name, Streamlit will put that file first in the list.
The name of each Streamlit app is determined by the file name, so to change the app name you need to change the file name!
We can add some fun to our app by adding emojis to our file names that will render in our Streamlit app.
Each page will have its own URL, defined by the name of the file.

Check out how we do all this below! For each new page, we create a new file inside the pages folder, and add the appropriate demo code into it.



pages/1_üìà_Plotting_Demo.py
pages/2_üåç_Mapping_Demo.py
pages/3_üìä_DataFrame_Demo.py

With our additional pages created, we can now put it all together in the final step below.

Run the multipage app

To run your newly converted multipage app, run:

streamlit run Hello.py


That‚Äôs it! The Hello.py script now corresponds to the main page of your app, and other scripts that Streamlit finds in the pages folder will also be present in the new page selector that appears in the sidebar.

Next steps

Congratulations! üéâ If you've read this far, chances are you've learned to create both single-page and multipage apps. Where you go from here is entirely up to your creativity! We‚Äôre excited to see what you‚Äôll build now that adding additional pages to your apps is easier than ever. Try adding more pages to the app we've just built as an exercise. Also, stop by the forum to show off your multipage apps with the Streamlit community! üéà

Here are a few resources to help you get started:

Deploy your app for free on Streamlit's Community Cloud.
Post a question or share your multipage app on our community forum.
Check out our documentation on Multipage apps.
Read through Advanced features for things like caching, theming, and adding statefulness to apps.

Display string formatted as Markdown.

Function signature
[source]

st.markdown(body, unsafe_allow_html=False, *, help=None)

Parameters

body (str)

The string to display as Github-flavored Markdown. Syntax information can be found at: https://github.github.com/gfm.

This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1: and :sunglasses:. For a list of all supported codes, see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

unsafe_allow_html (bool)

By default, any HTML tags found in the body will be escaped and therefore treated as pure text. This behavior may be turned off by setting this argument to True.

That said, we strongly advise against it. It is hard to write secure HTML, so by using this argument you may be compromising your users' security. For more information, see:

https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/152

help (str)

An optional tooltip that gets displayed next to the Markdown.

Examples
import streamlit as st

st.markdown("*Streamlit* is **really** ***cool***.")
st.markdown('''

st.column_config
Column configuration

When working with data in Streamlit, the st.column_config class is a powerful tool for configuring data display and interaction. Specifically designed for the column_config parameter in st.dataframe and st.data_editor, it provides a suite of methods to tailor your columns to various data types - from simple text and numbers to lists, URLs, images, and more.

Whether it's translating temporal data into user-friendly formats or utilizing charts and progress bars for clearer data visualization, column configuration not only provides the user with an enriched data viewing experience but also ensures that you're equipped with the tools to present and interact with your data, just the way you want it.

Display mathematical expressions formatted as LaTeX.

Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.

Function signature
[source]

st.latex(body, *, help=None)

Parameters

body (str or SymPy expression)

The string or SymPy expression to display as LaTeX. If str, it's a good idea to use raw Python strings since LaTeX uses backslashes a lot.

help (str)

An optional tooltip that gets displayed next to the LaTeX expression.

Example
import streamlit as st

st.latex(r'''
    a + ar + a r^2 + a r^3 + \cdots + a r^{n-1} =
    \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ar^k =
    a \left(\frac{1-r^{n}}{1-r}\right)
    ''')

Streamlit in Snowflake

Display text in small font.

This should be used for captions, asides, footnotes, sidenotes, and other explanatory text.

Function signature
[source]

st.caption(body, unsafe_allow_html=False, *, help=None)

Parameters

body (str)

The text to display as Github-flavored Markdown. Syntax information can be found at: https://github.github.com/gfm.

This also supports:

Emoji shortcodes, such as :+1: and :sunglasses:. For a list of all supported codes, see https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/emoji-shortcodes.
LaTeX expressions, by wrapping them in "$" or "$$" (the "$$" must be on their own lines). Supported LaTeX functions are listed at https://katex.org/docs/supported.html.
Colored text, using the syntax :color[text to be colored], where color needs to be replaced with any of the following supported colors: blue, green, orange, red, violet, gray/grey, rainbow.

unsafe_allow_html (bool)

By default, any HTML tags found in strings will be escaped and therefore treated as pure text. This behavior may be turned off by setting this argument to True.

That said, we strongly advise against it. It is hard to write secure HTML, so by using this argument you may be compromising your users' security. For more information, see:

https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/152

help (str)

An optional tooltip that gets displayed next to the caption.

Examples
import streamlit as st

st.caption('This is a string that explains something above.')
st.caption('A caption with _italics_ :blue[colors] and emojis :sunglasses:')

How Magic works
Featured video
Magic

Magic commands are a feature in Streamlit that allows you to write almost anything (markdown, data, charts) without having to type an explicit command at all. Just put the thing you want to show on its own line of code, and it will appear in your app. Here's an example:

# Draw a title and some text to the app:
'''
# This is the document title

This is some _markdown_.
'''

import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({'col1': [1,2,3]})
df  # üëà Draw the dataframe

x = 10
'x', x  # üëà Draw the string 'x' and then the value of x

# Also works with most supported chart types
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

arr = np.random.normal(1, 1, size=100)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(arr, bins=20)

fig  # üëà Draw a Matplotlib chart

How Magic works

Any time Streamlit sees either a variable or literal value on its own line, it automatically writes that to your app using st.write (which you'll learn about later).

Also, magic is smart enough to ignore docstrings. That is, it ignores the strings at the top of files and functions.

If you prefer to call Streamlit commands more explicitly, you can always turn magic off in your ~/.streamlit/config.toml with the following setting:

[runner]
magicEnabled = false

priority_high
Important

Right now, Magic only works in the main Python app file, not in imported files. See GitHub issue #288 for a discussion of the issues.

Caveats and limitations
Session State

Session State is a way to share variables between reruns, for each user session. In addition to the ability to store and persist state, Streamlit also exposes the ability to manipulate state using Callbacks. Session state also persists across apps inside a multipage app.

Check out this Session State basics tutorial video by Streamlit Developer Advocate Dr. Marisa Smith to get started:

Initialize values in Session State

The Session State API follows a field-based API, which is very similar to Python dictionaries:

# Initialization
if 'key' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state['key'] = 'value'

# Session State also supports attribute based syntax
if 'key' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.key = 'value'

Reads and updates

Read the value of an item in Session State and display it by passing to st.write :

# Read
st.write(st.session_state.key)

# Outputs: value


Update an item in Session State by assigning it a value:

st.session_state.key = 'value2'     # Attribute API
st.session_state['key'] = 'value2'  # Dictionary like API


Curious about what is in Session State? Use st.write or magic:

st.write(st.session_state)

# With magic:
st.session_state


Streamlit throws a handy exception if an uninitialized variable is accessed:

st.write(st.session_state['value'])

# Throws an exception!

Delete items

Delete items in Session State using the syntax to delete items in any Python dictionary:

# Delete a single key-value pair
del st.session_state[key]

# Delete all the items in Session state
for key in st.session_state.keys():
    del st.session_state[key]


Session State can also be cleared by going to Settings ‚Üí Clear Cache, followed by Rerunning the app.

Session State and Widget State association

Every widget with a key is automatically added to Session State:

st.text_input("Your name", key="name")

# This exists now:
st.session_state.name

Use Callbacks to update Session State

A callback is a python function which gets called when an input widget changes.

Order of execution: When updating Session state in response to events, a callback function gets executed first, and then the app is executed from top to bottom.

Callbacks can be used with widgets using the parameters on_change (or on_click), args, and kwargs:

Parameters

on_change or on_click - The function name to be used as a callback
args (tuple) - List of arguments to be passed to the callback function
kwargs (dict) - Named arguments to be passed to the callback function

Widgets which support the on_change event:

st.checkbox
st.color_picker
st.date_input
st.data_editor
st.file_uploader
st.multiselect
st.number_input
st.radio
st.select_slider
st.selectbox
st.slider
st.text_area
st.text_input
st.time_input
st.toggle

Widgets which support the on_click event:

st.button
st.download_button
st.form_submit_button

To add a callback, define a callback function above the widget declaration and pass it to the widget via the on_change (or on_click ) parameter.

Forms and Callbacks

Widgets inside a form can have their values be accessed and set via the Session State API. st.form_submit_button can have a callback associated with it. The callback gets executed upon clicking on the submit button. For example:

def form_callback():
    st.write(st.session_state.my_slider)
    st.write(st.session_state.my_checkbox)

with st.form(key='my_form'):
    slider_input = st.slider('My slider', 0, 10, 5, key='my_slider')
    checkbox_input = st.checkbox('Yes or No', key='my_checkbox')
    submit_button = st.form_submit_button(label='Submit', on_click=form_callback)

Serializable Session State

Serialization refers to the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be persisted and shared, and allowing you to recover the data‚Äôs original structure. Python‚Äôs built-in pickle module serializes Python objects to a byte stream ("pickling") and deserializes the stream into an object ("unpickling").

By default, Streamlit‚Äôs Session State allows you to persist any Python object for the duration of the session, irrespective of the object‚Äôs pickle-serializability. This property lets you store Python primitives such as integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers and booleans, dataframes, and even lambdas returned by functions. However, some execution environments may require serializing all data in Session State, so it may be useful to detect incompatibility during development, or when the execution environment will stop supporting it in the future.

To that end, Streamlit provides a runner.enforceSerializableSessionState configuration option that, when set to true, only allows pickle-serializable objects in Session State. To enable the option, either create a global or project config file with the following or use it as a command-line flag:

# .streamlit/config.toml
[runner]
enforceSerializableSessionState = true


By "pickle-serializable", we mean calling pickle.dumps(obj) should not raise a PicklingError exception. When the config option is enabled, adding unserializable data to session state should result in an exception. E.g.,

import streamlit as st

def unserializable_data():
		return lambda x: x

#üëá results in an exception when enforceSerializableSessionState is on
st.session_state.unserializable = unserializable_data()

priority_high
Warning

When runner.enforceSerializableSessionState is set to true, Session State implicitly uses the pickle module, which is known to be insecure. Ensure all data saved and retrieved from Session State is trusted because it is possible to construct malicious pickle data that will execute arbitrary code during unpickling. Never load data that could have come from an untrusted source in an unsafe mode or that could have been tampered with. Only load data you trust.

Caveats and limitations

Only the st.form_submit_button has a callback in forms. Other widgets inside a form are not allowed to have callbacks.

on_change and on_click events are only supported on input type widgets.

Modifying the value of a widget via the Session state API, after instantiating it, is not allowed and will raise a StreamlitAPIException. For example:

slider = st.slider(
    label='My Slider', min_value=1,
    max_value=10, value=5, key='my_slider')

st.session_state.my_slider = 7

# Throws an exception!


Setting the widget state via the Session State API and using the value parameter in the widget declaration is not recommended, and will throw a warning on the first run. For example:

st.session_state.my_slider = 7

slider = st.slider(
    label='Choose a Value', min_value=1,
    max_value=10, value=5, key='my_slider')


Setting the state of button-like widgets: st.button, st.download_button, and st.file_uploader via the Session State API is not allowed. Such type of widgets are by default False and have ephemeral True states which are only valid for a single run. For example:

if 'my_button' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.my_button = True

st.button('My button', key='my_button')

# Throws an exception!

Mutate charts
Mutate charts

Sometimes you display a chart or dataframe and want to modify live as the app runs (for example, in a loop). Depending on what you're looking for, there are 3 different ways to do this:

Using st.empty to replace a single element.
Using st.container or st.columns to replace multiple elements.
Using add_rows to append data to specific types of elements.

Here we discuss that last case.

element.add_rows
Streamlit Version
Version 1.30.0
Version 1.29.0
Version 1.28.0
Version 1.27.0
Version 1.26.0
Version 1.25.0
Version 1.24.0
Version 1.23.0
Version 1.22.0
Version 1.21.0
Version 1.20.0
Version 1.19.0
Version 1.18.0
Version 1.17.0

Version 1.15.0
Version 1.14.0
Version 1.13.0
Version 1.12.0
Version 1.11.0
Streamlit in Snowflake

Concatenate a dataframe to the bottom of the current one.

Function signature
[source]

element.add_rows(data=None, **kwargs)

Parameters

data (pandas.DataFrame, pandas.Styler, pyarrow.Table, numpy.ndarray, pyspark.sql.DataFrame, snowflake.snowpark.dataframe.DataFrame, Iterable, dict, or None)

Table to concat. Optional.

**kwargs (pandas.DataFrame, numpy.ndarray, Iterable, dict, or None)

The named dataset to concat. Optional. You can only pass in 1 dataset (including the one in the data parameter).

Example
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df1 = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(50, 20), columns=("col %d" % i for i in range(20)))

my_table = st.table(df1)

df2 = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(50, 20), columns=("col %d" % i for i in range(20)))

my_table.add_rows(df2)
# Now the table shown in the Streamlit app contains the data for
# df1 followed by the data for df2.
Copy

You can do the same thing with plots. For example, if you want to add more data to a line chart:

# Assuming df1 and df2 from the example above still exist...
my_chart = st.line_chart(df1)
my_chart.add_rows(df2)
# Now the chart shown in the Streamlit app contains the data for
# df1 followed by the data for df2.
Copy

And for plots whose datasets are named, you can pass the data with a keyword argument where the key is the name:

my_chart = st.vega_lite_chart({
    'mark': 'line',
    'encoding': {'x': 'a', 'y': 'b'},
    'datasets': {
      'some_fancy_name': df1,  # <-- named dataset
     },
    'data': {'name': 'some_fancy_name'},
}),
my_chart.add_rows(some_fancy_name=df2)  # <-- name used as keyword
Copy

Control flow
Change execution

By default, Streamlit apps execute the script entirely, but we allow some functionality to handle control flow in your applications.

Rerun script

Rerun the script immediately.

st.rerun()

Stop execution

Stops execution immediately.

st.stop()

Switch page

Programmatically navigates to a specified page.

st.switch_page("pages/my_page.py")

Group multiple widgets

By default, Streamlit reruns your script everytime a user interacts with your app. However, sometimes it's a better user experience to wait until a group of related widgets is filled before actually rerunning the script. That's what st.form is for!

Forms

Create a form that batches elements together with a ‚ÄúSubmit" button.

with st.form(key='my_form'):
    name = st.text_input("Name")
    email = st.text_input("Email")
    st.form_submit_button("Sign up")

Form submit button

Display a form submit button.

with st.form(key='my_form'):
    name = st.text_input("Name")
    email = st.text_input("Email")
    st.form_submit_button("Sign up")

Chat elements

Streamlit provides a few commands to help you build conversational apps. These chat elements are designed to be used in conjunction with each other, but you can also use them separately.

st.chat_message lets you insert a chat message container into the app so you can display messages from the user or the app. Chat containers can contain other Streamlit elements, including charts, tables, text, and more. st.chat_input lets you display a chat input widget so the user can type in a message. Remember to check out st.status to display output from long-running processes and external API calls.

Chat message

Insert a chat message container.

import numpy as np
with st.chat_message("user"):
    st.write("Hello üëã")
    st.line_chart(np.random.randn(30, 3))

Chat input

Display a chat input widget.

prompt = st.chat_input("Say something")
if prompt:
    st.write(f"The user has sent: {prompt}")

Status container

Display output of long-running tasks in a container.

with st.status('Running'):
  do_something_slow()

Complex layouts

Streamlit provides several options for controlling how different elements are laid out on the screen.

Sidebar

Display items in a sidebar.

st.sidebar.write("This lives in the sidebar")
st.sidebar.button("Click me!")

Columns

Insert containers laid out as side-by-side columns.

col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
col1.write("this is column 1")
col2.write("this is column 2")

Tabs

Insert containers separated into tabs.

tab1, tab2 = st.tabs(["Tab 1", "Tab2"])
tab1.write("this is tab 1")
tab2.write("this is tab 2")

Expander

Insert a multi-element container that can be expanded/collapsed.

with st.expander("Open to see more"):
  st.write("This is more content")

Container

Insert a multi-element container.

c = st.container()
st.write("This will show last")
c.write("This will show first")
c.write("This will show second")

Empty

Insert a single-element container.

c = st.empty()
st.write("This will show last")
c.write("This will be replaced")
c.write("This will show first")

Chart elements

Streamlit supports several different charting libraries, and our goal is to continually add support for more. Right now, the most basic library in our arsenal is Matplotlib. Then there are also interactive charting libraries like Vega Lite (2D charts) and deck.gl (maps and 3D charts). And finally we also provide a few chart types that are "native" to Streamlit, like st.line_chart and st.area_chart.

Simple area charts

Data elements

When you're working with data, it is extremely valuable to visualize that data quickly, interactively, and from multiple different angles. That's what Streamlit is actually built and optimized for.

You can display data via charts, and you can display it in raw form. These are the Streamlit commands you can use to display and interact with raw data.

Dataframes

Display a dataframe as an interactive table.

st.dataframe(my_data_frame)

Data editor

Display a data editor widget.

edited = st.data_editor(df, num_rows="dynamic")

Column configuration

Configure the display and editing behavior of dataframes and data editors.

st.column_config.NumberColumn("Price (in USD)", min_value=0, format="$%d")

Static tables

Display a static table.

st.table(my_data_frame)

Metrics

Display a metric in big bold font, with an optional indicator of how the metric changed.

st.metric("My metric", 42, 2)

Dicts and JSON

Display object or string as a pretty-printed JSON string.

st.json(my_dict)

Text elements

Streamlit apps usually start with a call to st.title to set the app's title. After that, there are 2 heading levels you can use: st.header and st.subheader.

Pure text is entered with st.text, and Markdown with st.markdown.

We also offer a "swiss-army knife" command called st.write, which accepts multiple arguments, and multiple data types. And as described above, you can also use magic commands in place of st.write.

Markdown

Display string formatted as Markdown.

st.markdown("Hello **world**!")

Title

Display text in title formatting.

st.title("The app title")

Header

Display text in header formatting.

st.header("This is a header")

Subheader

Display text in subheader formatting.

st.subheader("This is a subheader")

Caption

Display text in small font.

st.caption("This is written small caption text")

Code block

Display a code block with optional syntax highlighting.

st.code("a = 1234")

Preformatted text

Write fixed-width and preformatted text.

st.text("Hello world")

LaTeX

Display mathematical expressions formatted as LaTeX.

st.latex("\int a x^2 \,dx")

Divider

Display a horizontal rule.

st.divider()

st.write and magic commands

Streamlit has two easy ways to display information into your app, which should typically be the first thing you try: st.write and magic.

st.write

Write arguments to the app.

st.write("Hello **world**!")
st.write(my_data_frame)
st.write(my_mpl_figure)

Magic

Any time Streamlit sees either a variable or literal value on its own line, it automatically writes that to your app using st.write

"Hello **world**!"
my_data_frame
my_mpl_figure

Create an app

If you've made it this far, chances are you've installed Streamlit and run through the basics in Main concepts and Advanced concepts. If not, now is a good time to take a look.

The easiest way to learn how to use Streamlit is to try things out yourself. As you read through this guide, test each method. As long as your app is running, every time you add a new element to your script and save, Streamlit's UI will ask if you'd like to rerun the app and view the changes. This allows you to work in a fast interactive loop: you write some code, save it, review the output, write some more, and so on, until you're happy with the results. The goal is to use Streamlit to create an interactive app for your data or model and along the way to use Streamlit to review, debug, perfect, and share your code.

In this guide, you're going to use Streamlit's core features to create an interactive app; exploring a public Uber dataset for pickups and drop-offs in New York City. When you're finished, you'll know how to fetch and cache data, draw charts, plot information on a map, and use interactive widgets, like a slider, to filter results.

Tip

If you'd like to skip ahead and see everything at once, the complete script is available below.

Create your first app

Streamlit is more than just a way to make data apps, it‚Äôs also a community of creators that share their apps and ideas and help each other make their work better. Please come join us on the community forum. We love to hear your questions, ideas, and help you work through your bugs ‚Äî stop by today!

The first step is to create a new Python script. Let's call it uber_pickups.py.

Open uber_pickups.py in your favorite IDE or text editor, then add these lines:

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np


Every good app has a title, so let's add one:

st.title('Uber pickups in NYC')


Now it's time to run Streamlit from the command line:

streamlit run uber_pickups.py


Running a Streamlit app is no different than any other Python script. Whenever you need to view the app, you can use this command.

star
Tip

Did you know you can also pass a URL to streamlit run? This is great when combined with GitHub Gists. For example:

streamlit run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamlit/demo-uber-nyc-pickups/master/streamlit_app.py


As usual, the app should automatically open in a new tab in your browser.

Fetch some data

Now that you have an app, the next thing you'll need to do is fetch the Uber dataset for pickups and drop-offs in New York City.

Let's start by writing a function to load the data. Add this code to your script:

DATE_COLUMN = 'date/time'
DATA_URL = ('https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/'
         'streamlit-demo-data/uber-raw-data-sep14.csv.gz')

def load_data(nrows):
    data = pd.read_csv(DATA_URL, nrows=nrows)
    lowercase = lambda x: str(x).lower()
    data.rename(lowercase, axis='columns', inplace=True)
    data[DATE_COLUMN] = pd.to_datetime(data[DATE_COLUMN])
    return data


You'll notice that load_data is a plain old function that downloads some data, puts it in a Pandas dataframe, and converts the date column from text to datetime. The function accepts a single parameter (nrows), which specifies the number of rows that you want to load into the dataframe.

Now let's test the function and review the output. Below your function, add these lines:

# Create a text element and let the reader know the data is loading.
data_load_state = st.text('Loading data...')
# Load 10,000 rows of data into the dataframe.
data = load_data(10000)
# Notify the reader that the data was successfully loaded.
data_load_state.text('Loading data...done!')


You'll see a few buttons in the upper-right corner of your app asking if you'd like to rerun the app. Choose Always rerun, and you'll see your changes automatically each time you save.

Ok, that's underwhelming...

It turns out that it takes a long time to download data, and load 10,000 lines into a dataframe. Converting the date column into datetime isn‚Äôt a quick job either. You don‚Äôt want to reload the data each time the app is updated ‚Äì luckily Streamlit allows you to cache the data.

Effortless caching

Try adding @st.cache_data before the load_data declaration:

@st.cache_data
def load_data(nrows):


Then save the script, and Streamlit will automatically rerun your app. Since this is the first time you‚Äôre running the script with @st.cache_data, you won't see anything change. Let‚Äôs tweak your file a little bit more so that you can see the power of caching.

Replace the line data_load_state.text('Loading data...done!') with this:

data_load_state.text("Done! (using st.cache_data)")


Now save. See how the line you added appeared immediately? If you take a step back for a second, this is actually quite amazing. Something magical is happening behind the scenes, and it only takes one line of code to activate it.

How's it work?

Let's take a few minutes to discuss how @st.cache_data actually works.

When you mark a function with Streamlit‚Äôs cache annotation, it tells Streamlit that whenever the function is called that it should check two things:

The input parameters you used for the function call.
The code inside the function.

If this is the first time Streamlit has seen both these items, with these exact values, and in this exact combination, it runs the function and stores the result in a local cache. The next time the function is called, if the two values haven't changed, then Streamlit knows it can skip executing the function altogether. Instead, it reads the output from the local cache and passes it on to the caller -- like magic.

"But, wait a second," you‚Äôre saying to yourself, "this sounds too good to be true. What are the limitations of all this awesomesauce?"

Well, there are a few:

Streamlit will only check for changes within the current working directory. If you upgrade a Python library, Streamlit's cache will only notice this if that library is installed inside your working directory.
If your function is not deterministic (that is, its output depends on random numbers), or if it pulls data from an external time-varying source (for example, a live stock market ticker service) the cached value will be none-the-wiser.
Lastly, you should avoid mutating the output of a function cached with st.cache_data since cached values are stored by reference.

While these limitations are important to keep in mind, they tend not to be an issue a surprising amount of the time. Those times, this cache is really transformational.

star
Tip

Whenever you have a long-running computation in your code, consider refactoring it so you can use @st.cache_data, if possible. Please read Caching for more details.

Now that you know how caching with Streamlit works, let‚Äôs get back to the Uber pickup data.

Inspect the raw data

It's always a good idea to take a look at the raw data you're working with before you start working with it. Let's add a subheader and a printout of the raw data to the app:

st.subheader('Raw data')
st.write(data)


In the Main concepts guide you learned that st.write will render almost anything you pass to it. In this case, you're passing in a dataframe and it's rendering as an interactive table.

st.write tries to do the right thing based on the data type of the input. If it isn't doing what you expect you can use a specialized command like st.dataframe instead. For a full list, see API reference.

Draw a histogram

Now that you've had a chance to take a look at the dataset and observe what's available, let's take things a step further and draw a histogram to see what Uber's busiest hours are in New York City.

To start, let's add a subheader just below the raw data section:

st.subheader('Number of pickups by hour')


Use NumPy to generate a histogram that breaks down pickup times binned by hour:

hist_values = np.histogram(
    data[DATE_COLUMN].dt.hour, bins=24, range=(0,24))[0]


Now, let's use Streamlit's st.bar_chart() method to draw this histogram.

st.bar_chart(hist_values)


Save your script. This histogram should show up in your app right away. After a quick review, it looks like the busiest time is 17:00 (5 P.M.).

To draw this diagram we used Streamlit's native bar_chart() method, but it's important to know that Streamlit supports more complex charting libraries like Altair, Bokeh, Plotly, Matplotlib and more. For a full list, see supported charting libraries.

Plot data on a map

Using a histogram with Uber's dataset helped us determine what the busiest times are for pickups, but what if we wanted to figure out where pickups were concentrated throughout the city. While you could use a bar chart to show this data, it wouldn't be easy to interpret unless you were intimately familiar with latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates in the city. To show pickup concentration, let's use Streamlit st.map() function to overlay the data on a map of New York City.

Add a subheader for the section:

st.subheader('Map of all pickups')


Use the st.map() function to plot the data:

st.map(data)


Save your script. The map is fully interactive. Give it a try by panning or zooming in a bit.

After drawing your histogram, you determined that the busiest hour for Uber pickups was 17:00. Let's redraw the map to show the concentration of pickups at 17:00.

Locate the following code snippet:

st.subheader('Map of all pickups')
st.map(data)


Replace it with:

hour_to_filter = 17
filtered_data = data[data[DATE_COLUMN].dt.hour == hour_to_filter]
st.subheader(f'Map of all pickups at {hour_to_filter}:00')
st.map(filtered_data)


You should see the data update instantly.

To draw this map we used the st.map function that's built into Streamlit, but if you'd like to visualize complex map data, we encourage you to take a look at the st.pydeck_chart.

Filter results with a slider

In the last section, when you drew the map, the time used to filter results was hardcoded into the script, but what if we wanted to let a reader dynamically filter the data in real time? Using Streamlit's widgets you can. Let's add a slider to the app with the st.slider() method.

Locate hour_to_filter and replace it with this code snippet:

hour_to_filter = st.slider('hour', 0, 23, 17)  # min: 0h, max: 23h, default: 17h


Use the slider and watch the map update in real time.

Use a button to toggle data

Sliders are just one way to dynamically change the composition of your app. Let's use the st.checkbox function to add a checkbox to your app. We'll use this checkbox to show/hide the raw data table at the top of your app.

Locate these lines:

st.subheader('Raw data')
st.write(data)


Replace these lines with the following code:

if st.checkbox('Show raw data'):
    st.subheader('Raw data')
    st.write(data)


We're sure you've got your own ideas. When you're done with this tutorial, check out all the widgets that Streamlit exposes in our API Reference.

Let's put it all together

That's it, you've made it to the end. Here's the complete script for our interactive app.

star
Tip

If you've skipped ahead, after you've created your script, the command to run Streamlit is streamlit run [app name].

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

st.title('Uber pickups in NYC')

DATE_COLUMN = 'date/time'
DATA_URL = ('https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/'
            'streamlit-demo-data/uber-raw-data-sep14.csv.gz')

@st.cache_data
def load_data(nrows):
    data = pd.read_csv(DATA_URL, nrows=nrows)
    lowercase = lambda x: str(x).lower()
    data.rename(lowercase, axis='columns', inplace=True)
    data[DATE_COLUMN] = pd.to_datetime(data[DATE_COLUMN])
    return data

data_load_state = st.text('Loading data...')
data = load_data(10000)
data_load_state.text("Done! (using st.cache_data)")

if st.checkbox('Show raw data'):
    st.subheader('Raw data')
    st.write(data)

st.subheader('Number of pickups by hour')
hist_values = np.histogram(data[DATE_COLUMN].dt.hour, bins=24, range=(0,24))[0]
st.bar_chart(hist_values)

# Some number in the range 0-23
hour_to_filter = st.slider('hour', 0, 23, 17)
filtered_data = data[data[DATE_COLUMN].dt.hour == hour_to_filter]

st.subheader('Map of all pickups at %s:00' % hour_to_filter)
st.map(filtered_data)

Summary
App model summary

Now that you know a little more about all the individual pieces, let's close the loop and review how it works together:

Streamlit apps are Python scripts that run from top to bottom.
Every time a user opens a browser tab pointing to your app, the script is executed and a new session starts.
As the script executes, Streamlit draws its output live in a browser.
Every time a user interacts with a widget, your script is re-executed and Streamlit redraws its output in the brower.
The output value of that widget matches the new value during that rerun.
Scripts use the Streamlit cache to avoid recomputing expensive functions, so updates happen very fast.
Session State lets you save information that persists between reruns when you need more than a simple widget.
Streamlit apps can contain multiple pages, which are defined in separate .py files in a pages folder.

Additional Streamlit features

So you've read all about Streamlit's Main concepts and gotten a tase of caching and Session State in Advanced concepts. But what about the bells and whistles? Here's a quick look at some extra features to take your app to the next level.

Theming

Streamlit supports Light and Dark themes out of the box. Streamlit will first check if the user viewing an app has a Light or Dark mode preference set by their operating system and browser. If so, then that preference will be used. Otherwise, the Light theme is applied by default.

You can also change the active theme from "‚ãÆ" ‚Üí "Settings".

Want to add your own theme to an app? The "Settings" menu has a theme editor accessible by clicking on "Edit active theme". You can use this editor to try out different colors and see your app update live.

When you're happy with your work, themes can be saved by setting config options in the [theme] config section. After you've defined a theme for your app, it will appear as "Custom Theme" in the theme selector and will be applied by default instead of the included Light and Dark themes.

More information about the options available when defining a theme can be found in the theme option documentation.

The theme editor menu is available only in local development. If you've deployed your app using Streamlit Community Cloud, the "Edit active theme" button will no longer be displayed in the "Settings" menu.

Tip

Another way to experiment with different theme colors is to turn on the "Run on save" option, edit your config.toml file, and watch as your app reruns with the new theme colors applied.

Pages

As apps grow large, it becomes useful to organize them into multiple pages. This makes the app easier to manage as a developer and easier to navigate as a user. Streamlit provides a frictionless way to create multipage apps.

We designed this feature so that building a multipage app is as easy as building a single-page app! Just add more pages to an existing app as follows:

In the folder containing your main script, create a new pages folder. Let‚Äôs say your main script is named main_page.py.
Add new .py files in the pages folder to add more pages to your app.
Run streamlit run main_page.py as usual.

That‚Äôs it! The main_page.py script will now correspond to the main page of your app. And you‚Äôll see the other scripts from the pages folder in the sidebar page selector. The pages are listed according to filename (without file extensions and disregarding underscores). For example:

main_page.py
import streamlit as st

st.markdown("# Main page üéà")
st.sidebar.markdown("# Main page üéà")

pages/page_2.py
import streamlit as st

st.markdown("# Page 2 ‚ùÑÔ∏è")
st.sidebar.markdown("# Page 2 ‚ùÑÔ∏è")

pages/page_3.py
import streamlit as st

st.markdown("# Page 3 üéâ")
st.sidebar.markdown("# Page 3 üéâ")




Now run streamlit run main_page.py and view your shiny new multipage app!

Our documentation on Multipage apps teaches you how to add pages to your app, including how to define pages, structure and run multipage apps, and navigate between pages. Once you understand the basics, create your first multipage app!

Static file serving

As you learned in Streamlit fundamentals, Streamlit runs a server that clients connect to. That means viewers of your app don't have direct access to the files which are local to your to your app. Most of the time, this doesn't matter because Streamlt commands handle that for you. When you use st.image(<path-to-image>) your Streamlit server will access the file and handle the necessary hosting so your app viewers can see it. However, if you want a direct URL to an image or file you'll need to host it. This requires setting the correct configuration and placing your hosted files in a directory named static. For example, your project could look like:

your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my_hosted-image.png
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ streamlit_app.py


To learn more, read our guide on Static file serving.

App testing

Good development hygeine includes testing your code. Automated testing allows you to write higher quality code, faster! Streamlit has a built-in testing framework that let's you build tests easily. Use your favorite testing framework to run your tests. We like pytest. When you test a Streamlit app, you simulate running the app, declare user input, and inspect the results. You can use GitHub workflows to automate your tests and get instant alerts about breaking changes. Learn more in our guide to App testing.

Install Streamlit using command line

This page will walk you through creating an environment with venv and installing Streamlit with pip. These are our recommended tools, but if you are familiar with others you can use your favorite ones too. At the end, you'll build a simple "Hello world" app and run it. If you prefer to have a graphical interface to manage your Python environments, check out how to Install Streamlit using Anaconda Distribution.

Prerequisites

As with any programming tool, in order to install Streamlit you first need to make sure your computer is properly set up. More specifically, you‚Äôll need:

Python

We support version 3.8 to 3.12.

A Python environment manager (recommended)

Environment managers create virtual environments to isolate Python package installations between projects.

We recommend using virtual environments because installing or upgrading a Python package may cause unintentional effects on another package. For a detailed introduction to Python environments, check out Python Virtual Environments: A Primer.

For this guide, we'll be using venv, which comes with Python.

A Python package manager

Package managers handle installing each of your Python packages, including Streamlit.

For this guide, we'll be using pip, which comes with Python.

Only on MacOS: Xcode command line tools

Download Xcode command line tools using these instructions in order to let the package manager install some of Streamlit's dependencies.

A code editor

Our favorite editor is VS Code, which is also what we use in all our tutorials.

Create an environment using
venv

Open a terminal and navigate to your project folder.

cd myproject


In your terminal, type:

python -m venv .venv


A folder named ".venv" will appear in your project. This directory is where your virtual environment and its dependencies are installed.

Activate your environment

In your terminal, activate your environment with one of the following commands, depending on your operating system.

# Windows command prompt
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Windows PowerShell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# macOS and Linux
source .venv/bin/activate


Once activated, you will see your environment name in parentheses before your prompt. "(.venv)"

Install Streamlit in your environment

In the terminal with your environment activated, type:

pip install streamlit


Test that the installation worked by launching the Streamlit Hello example app:

streamlit hello


If this doesn't work, use the long-form command:

python -m streamlit hello


Streamlit's Hello app should appear in a new tab in your web browser!

Close your terminal when you are done.

Create a "Hello World" app and run it
Create a file named app.py in your project folder.
import streamlit as st

st.write("Hello world")

Any time you want to use your new environment, you first need to go to your project folder (where the .venv directory lives) and run the command to activate it:
# Windows command prompt
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Windows PowerShell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# macOS and Linux
source .venv/bin/activate


Once activated, you will see your environment's name in parentheses at the beginning of your terminal prompt. "(.venv)"

Run your Streamlit app.

streamlit run app.py


If this doesn't work, use the long-form command:

python -m streamlit run app.py


To stop the Streamlit server, press Ctrl+C in the terminal.

When you're done using this environment, return to your normal shell by typing:

deactivate

Caching

Advanced concepts of Streamlit

Now that you know how a Streamlit app runs and handles data, let's talk about being efficient. Caching allows you to save the output of a function so you can skip over it on rerun. Session State lets you save information for each user that is preserved between reruns. This not only allows you to avoid unecessary recalculation, but also allows you to create dynamic pages and handle progressive processes.

Caching

The Streamlit cache allows your app to stay performant even when loading data from the web, manipulating large datasets, or performing expensive computations.

The basic idea behind caching is to store the results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again rather than calling the function on subsequent runs.

To cache a function in Streamlit, you need to decorate it with one of two decorators (st.cache_data and st.cache_resource):

@st.cache_data
def long_running_function(param1, param2):
    return ‚Ä¶


In this example, decorating long_running_function with @st.cache_data tells Streamlit that whenever the function is called, it checks two things:

The values of the input parameters (in this case, param1 and param2).
The code inside the function.

If this is the first time Streamlit sees these parameter values and function code, it runs the function and stores the return value in a cache. The next time the function is called with the same parameters and code (e.g., when a user interacts with the app), Streamlit will skip executing the function altogether and return the cached value instead. During development, the cache updates automatically as the function code changes, ensuring that the latest changes are reflected in the cache.

As mentioned, there are two caching decorators:

st.cache_data¬†is the recommended way to cache computations that return data: loading a DataFrame from CSV, transforming a NumPy array, querying an API, or any other function that returns a serializable data object (str, int, float, DataFrame, array, list, ‚Ä¶). It creates a new copy of the data at each function call, making it safe against mutations and race conditions. The behavior of st.cache_data is what you want in most cases ‚Äì so if you're unsure, start with¬†st.cache_data¬†and see if it works!
st.cache_resource¬†is the recommended way to cache global resources like ML models or database connections ‚Äì unserializable objects that you don‚Äôt want to load multiple times. Using it, you can share these resources across all reruns and sessions of an app without copying or duplication. Note that any mutations to the cached return value directly mutate the object in the cache (more details below).

Streamlit's two caching decorators and their use cases.

For more information about the Streamlit caching decorators, their configuration parameters, and their limitations, see Caching.

Session State

Session State provides a dictionary-like interface where you can save information that is preserved between script reruns. Use st.session_state with key or attribute notation to store and recall values. For example, st.session_state["my_key"] or st.session_state.my_key. Remember that widgets handle thier statefulness all by themselves, so you won't always need to use Session State!

What is a session?

A session is a single instance of viewing an app. If you view an app from two different tabs in your browser, each tab will have its own session. So each viewer of an app will have a Session State tied to their specific view. Streamlit maintains this session as the user interacts with the app. If the user refreshes their browser page or reloads the URL to the app, their Session State resets and they begin again with a new session.

Examples of using Session State

Here's a simple app that counts the number of times the page has been run. Every time you click the button, the script will rerun.

import streamlit as st

if "counter" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.counter = 0

st.session_state.counter += 1

st.header(f"This page has run {st.session_state.counter} times.")
st.button("Run it again")


First run: The first time the app runs for each user, Session State is empty. Therefore, a key-value pair is created ("counter":0). As the script continues, the counter is immediately incremented ("counter":1) and the result is displayed: "This page has run 1 times." When the page has fully rendered, the script has finished and the Streamlit server waits for the user to do something. When that user clicks the button, a rerun begins.

Second run: Since "counter" is already a key in Session State, it is not reinitialized. As the script continues, the counter is incremented ("counter":2) and the result is displayed: "This page has run 2 times."

There are a few common scenarios where Session State is helpful. As demonstrated above, Session State is used when you have a progressive process that you want to build upon from one rerun to the next. Session State can also be used to prevent recalculation, similar to caching. However, the differences are important:

Caching associates stored values to specific functions and inputs. Cached values are accessible to all users across all sessions.
Session State associates stored values to keys (strings). Values in session state are only available in the single session where it was saved.

If you have random number generation in your app, you'd likely use Session State. Here's an example where data is generated randomly at the beginning of each session. By saving this random information in Session State, each user gets different random data when they open the app but it won't keep changing on them as they interact with it. If you select different colors with the picker you'll see that the data does not get re-randomized with each rerun. (If you open the app in a new tab to start a new session, you'll see different data!)

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

if "df" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(20, 2), columns=["x", "y"])

st.header("Choose a datapoint color")
color = st.color_picker("Color", "#FF0000")
st.divider()
st.scatter_chart(st.session_state.df, x="x", y="y", color=color)


If you are pulling the same data for all users, you'd likely cache a function that retrieves that data. On the other hand, if you pull data specific to a user, such as querying their personal information, you may want to save that in Session State. That way, the queried data is only available in that one session.

As mentioned in Main concepts, Session State is also related to widgets. Widgets are magical and handle statefulness quietly on their own. As an advanced feature however, you can manipulate the value of widgets within your code by assigning keys to them. Any key assigned to a widget becomes a key in Session State tied to the value of the widget. This can be used to manipulate the widget. After you finish understanding the basics of Streamlit, check out our guide on Widget behavior to dig in the details if you're interested.

Connections

As hinted above, you can use @st.cache_resource to cache connections. This is the most general solution which allows you to use almost any connection from any Python library. However, Streamlit also offers a convenient way to handle some of the most popular connections, like SQL! st.connection takes care of the caching for you so you can enjoy fewer lines of code. Getting data from your database can be as easy as:

import streamlit as st

conn = st.connection("my_database")
df = conn.query("select * from my_table")
st.dataframe(df)


Of course, you may be wondering where your username and password go. Streamlit has a convenient mechanism for Secrets management. For now, let's just see how st.connection works very nicely with secrets. In your local project directory, you can save a .streamlit/secrets.toml file. You save your secrets in the toml file and st.connection just uses them! For example, if you have an app file streamlit_app.py your project directory may look like this:

your-LOCAL-repository/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .streamlit/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ secrets.toml # Make sure to gitignore this!
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ streamlit_app.py


For the above SQL example, your secrets.toml file might look like the following:

[connections.my_database]
    type="sql"
    dialect="mysql"
    username="xxx"
    password="xxx"
    host="example.com" # IP or URL
    port=3306 # Port number
    database="mydb" # Database name


Since you don't want to commit your secrets.toml file to your repository, you'll need to learn how your host handles secrets when you're ready to publish your app. Each host platform may have a different way for you to pass your secrets. If you use Stramlit Community Cloud for example, each deployed app has a settings menu where you can load your secrets. After you've written an app and are ready to deploy, you can read all about how to Deploy your app on Community Cloud.

Main concepts of Streamlit

Working with Streamlit is simple. First you sprinkle a few Streamlit commands into a normal Python script, then you run it with streamlit run:

streamlit run your_script.py [-- script args]


As soon as you run the script as shown above, a local Streamlit server will spin up and your app will open in a new tab in your default web browser. The app is your canvas, where you'll draw charts, text, widgets, tables, and more.

What gets drawn in the app is up to you. For example st.text writes raw text to your app, and st.line_chart draws ‚Äî you guessed it ‚Äî a line chart. Refer to our API documentation to see all commands that are available to you.

push_pin
Note

When passing your script some custom arguments, they must be passed after two dashes. Otherwise the arguments get interpreted as arguments to Streamlit itself.

Another way of running Streamlit is to run it as a Python module. This can be useful when configuring an IDE like PyCharm to work with Streamlit:

# Running
python -m streamlit run your_script.py

# is equivalent to:
streamlit run your_script.py

star
Tip

You can also pass a URL to streamlit run! This is great when combined with GitHub Gists. For example:

streamlit run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streamlit/demo-uber-nyc-pickups/master/streamlit_app.py

Development flow

Every time you want to update your app, save the source file. When you do that, Streamlit detects if there is a change and asks you whether you want to rerun your app. Choose "Always rerun" at the top-right of your screen to automatically update your app every time you change its source code.

This allows you to work in a fast interactive loop: you type some code, save it, try it out live, then type some more code, save it, try it out, and so on until you're happy with the results. This tight loop between coding and viewing results live is one of the ways Streamlit makes your life easier.

star
Tip

While developing a Streamlit app, it's recommended to lay out your editor and browser windows side by side, so the code and the app can be seen at the same time. Give it a try!

As of Streamlit version 1.10.0 and higher, Streamlit apps cannot be run from the root directory of Linux distributions. If you try to run a Streamlit app from the root directory, Streamlit will throw a FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory error. For more information, see GitHub issue #5239.

If you are using Streamlit version 1.10.0 or higher, your main script should live in a directory other than the root directory. When using Docker, you can use the WORKDIR command to specify the directory where your main script lives. For an example of how to do this, read Create a Dockerfile.

Data flow

Streamlit's architecture allows you to write apps the same way you write plain Python scripts. To unlock this, Streamlit apps have a unique data flow: any time something must be updated on the screen, Streamlit reruns your entire Python script from top to bottom.

This can happen in two situations:

Whenever you modify your app's source code.

Whenever a user interacts with widgets in the app. For example, when dragging a slider, entering text in an input box, or clicking a button.

Whenever a callback is passed to a widget via the on_change (or on_click) parameter, the callback will always run before the rest of your script. For details on the Callbacks API, please refer to our Session State API Reference Guide.

And to make all of this fast and seamless, Streamlit does some heavy lifting for you behind the scenes. A big player in this story is the @st.cache_data decorator, which allows developers to skip certain costly computations when their apps rerun. We'll cover caching later in this page.

Display and style data

There are a few ways to display data (tables, arrays, data frames) in Streamlit apps. Below, you will be introduced to magic and st.write(), which can be used to write anything from text to tables. After that, let's take a look at methods designed specifically for visualizing data.

Use magic

You can also write to your app without calling any Streamlit methods. Streamlit supports "magic commands," which means you don't have to use st.write() at all! To see this in action try this snippet:

"""
# My first app
Here's our first attempt at using data to create a table:
"""

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({
  'first column': [1, 2, 3, 4],
  'second column': [10, 20, 30, 40]
})

df


Any time that Streamlit sees a variable or a literal value on its own line, it automatically writes that to your app using st.write(). For more information, refer to the documentation on magic commands.

Write a data frame

Along with magic commands, st.write() is Streamlit's "Swiss Army knife". You can pass almost anything to st.write(): text, data, Matplotlib figures, Altair charts, and more. Don't worry, Streamlit will figure it out and render things the right way.

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

st.write("Here's our first attempt at using data to create a table:")
st.write(pd.DataFrame({
    'first column': [1, 2, 3, 4],
    'second column': [10, 20, 30, 40]
}))


There are other data specific functions like st.dataframe() and st.table() that you can also use for displaying data. Let's understand when to use these features and how to add colors and styling to your data frames.

You might be asking yourself, "why wouldn't I always use st.write()?" There are a few reasons:

Magic and st.write() inspect the type of data that you've passed in, and then decide how to best render it in the app. Sometimes you want to draw it another way. For example, instead of drawing a dataframe as an interactive table, you may want to draw it as a static table by using st.table(df).
The second reason is that other methods return an object that can be used and modified, either by adding data to it or replacing it.
Finally, if you use a more specific Streamlit method you can pass additional arguments to customize its behavior.

For example, let's create a data frame and change its formatting with a Pandas Styler object. In this example, you'll use Numpy to generate a random sample, and the st.dataframe() method to draw an interactive table.

push_pin
Note

This example uses Numpy to generate a random sample, but you can use Pandas DataFrames, Numpy arrays, or plain Python arrays.

import streamlit as st
import numpy as np

dataframe = np.random.randn(10, 20)
st.dataframe(dataframe)


Let's expand on the first example using the Pandas Styler object to highlight some elements in the interactive table.

import streamlit as st
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

dataframe = pd.DataFrame(
    np.random.randn(10, 20),
    columns=('col %d' % i for i in range(20)))

st.dataframe(dataframe.style.highlight_max(axis=0))


Streamlit also has a method for static table generation: st.table().

import streamlit as st
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

dataframe = pd.DataFrame(
    np.random.randn(10, 20),
    columns=('col %d' % i for i in range(20)))
st.table(dataframe)

Draw charts and maps

Streamlit supports several popular data charting libraries like Matplotlib, Altair, deck.gl, and more. In this section, you'll add a bar chart, line chart, and a map to your app.

Draw a line chart

You can easily add a line chart to your app with st.line_chart(). We'll generate a random sample using Numpy and then chart it.

import streamlit as st
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

chart_data = pd.DataFrame(
     np.random.randn(20, 3),
     columns=['a', 'b', 'c'])

st.line_chart(chart_data)

Plot a map

With st.map() you can display data points on a map. Let's use Numpy to generate some sample data and plot it on a map of San Francisco.

import streamlit as st
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

map_data = pd.DataFrame(
    np.random.randn(1000, 2) / [50, 50] + [37.76, -122.4],
    columns=['lat', 'lon'])

st.map(map_data)

Widgets

When you've got the data or model into the state that you want to explore, you can add in widgets like st.slider(), st.button() or st.selectbox(). It's really straightforward ‚Äî treat widgets as variables:

import streamlit as st
x = st.slider('x')  # üëà this is a widget
st.write(x, 'squared is', x * x)


On first run, the app above should output the text "0 squared is 0". Then every time a user interacts with a widget, Streamlit simply reruns your script from top to bottom, assigning the current state of the widget to your variable in the process.

For example, if the user moves the slider to position 10, Streamlit will rerun the code above and set x to 10 accordingly. So now you should see the text "10 squared is 100".

Widgets can also be accessed by key, if you choose to specify a string to use as the unique key for the widget:

import streamlit as st
st.text_input("Your name", key="name")

# You can access the value at any point with:
st.session_state.name


Every widget with a key is automatically added to Session State. For more information about Session State, its association with widget state, and its limitations, see Session State API Reference Guide.

Use checkboxes to show/hide data

One use case for checkboxes is to hide or show a specific chart or section in an app. st.checkbox() takes a single argument, which is the widget label. In this sample, the checkbox is used to toggle a conditional statement.

import streamlit as st
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

if st.checkbox('Show dataframe'):
    chart_data = pd.DataFrame(
       np.random.randn(20, 3),
       columns=['a', 'b', 'c'])

    chart_data

Use a selectbox for options

Use st.selectbox to choose from a series. You can write in the options you want, or pass through an array or data frame column.

Let's use the df data frame we created earlier.

import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'first column': [1, 2, 3, 4],
    'second column': [10, 20, 30, 40]
    })

option = st.selectbox(
    'Which number do you like best?',
     df['first column'])

'You selected: ', option

Layout

Streamlit makes it easy to organize your widgets in a left panel sidebar with st.sidebar. Each element that's passed to st.sidebar is pinned to the left, allowing users to focus on the content in your app while still having access to UI controls.

For example, if you want to add a selectbox and a slider to a sidebar, use st.sidebar.slider and st.sidebar.selectbox instead of st.slider and st.selectbox:

import streamlit as st

# Add a selectbox to the sidebar:
add_selectbox = st.sidebar.selectbox(
    'How would you like to be contacted?',
    ('Email', 'Home phone', 'Mobile phone')
)

# Add a slider to the sidebar:
add_slider = st.sidebar.slider(
    'Select a range of values',
    0.0, 100.0, (25.0, 75.0)
)


Beyond the sidebar, Streamlit offers several other ways to control the layout of your app. st.columns lets you place widgets side-by-side, and st.expander lets you conserve space by hiding away large content.

import streamlit as st

left_column, right_column = st.columns(2)
# You can use a column just like st.sidebar:
left_column.button('Press me!')

# Or even better, call Streamlit functions inside a "with" block:
with right_column:
    chosen = st.radio(
        'Sorting hat',
        ("Gryffindor", "Ravenclaw", "Hufflepuff", "Slytherin"))
    st.write(f"You are in {chosen} house!")

push_pin
Note

st.echo and st.spinner are not currently supported inside the sidebar or layout options. Rest assured, though, we're currently working on adding support for those too!

Show progress

When adding long running computations to an app, you can use st.progress() to display status in real time.

First, let's import time. We're going to use the time.sleep() method to simulate a long running computation:

import time


Now, let's create a progress bar:

import streamlit as st
import time

'Starting a long computation...'

# Add a placeholder
latest_iteration = st.empty()
bar = st.progress(0)

for i in range(100):
  # Update the progress bar with each iteration.
  latest_iteration.text(f'Iteration {i+1}')
  bar.progress(i + 1)
  time.sleep(0.1)

'...and now we\'re done!'

Install Streamlit using Anaconda Distribution

This page walks you through installing Streamlit locally using Anaconda Distribution. At the end, you'll build a simple "Hello world" app and run it. You can read more about Getting started with Anaconda Distribution in Anaconda's docs. If you prefer to manage your Python environments via command line, check out how to Install Streamlit using command line.

Prerequisites

A code editor

Anaconda Distribution includes Python and basically everything you need to get started. The only thing left for you to choose is a code editor.

Our favorite editor is VS Code, which is also what we use in all our tutorials.

Knowledge about environment managers

Environment managers create virtual environments to isolate Python package installations between projects. For a detailed introduction to Python environments, check out Python Virtual Environments: A Primer.

But don't worry! In this guide we'll teach you how to install and use an environment manager (Anaconda).

Install Anaconda Distribution

Go to anaconda.com/download.

Install Anaconda Distribution for your OS.

Create an environment using Anaconda Navigator

Open Anaconda Navigator (the graphical interface included with Anaconda Distribution).

You can decline signing in to Anaconda if prompted.

In the left menu, click "Environments". 

At the bottom of your environments list, click "Create". 

Enter "streamlitenv" for the name of your environment.

Click "Create."

Activate your environment

Click the green play icon (play_circle) next to your environment.

Click "Open Terminal." 

A terminal will open with your environment activated. Your environment's name will appear in parentheses at the beginning of your terminal's prompt to show that it's activated.

Install Streamlit in your environment

In your terminal, type:

pip install streamlit


To validate your installation, enter:

streamlit hello


If this doesn't work, use the long-form command:

python -m streamlit hello


The Streamlit Hello example app will automatically open in your browser. If it doesn't, open your browser and go to the localhost address indicated in your terminal, typically http://localhost:8501. Play around with the app!

Close your terminal.

Create a
Hello World
app and run it

Open VS Code with a new project.

Create a Python file named app.py in your project folder. 

Copy the following code into app.py and save it.

import streamlit as st

st.write("Hello World")


Click your Python interpreter in the lower-right corner, then choose your streamlitenv environment from the drop-down. 

Right-click app.py in your file navigation and click "Open in integrated terminal". 

A terminal will open with your environment activated. Confirm this by looking for "(streamlitenv)" at the beginning of your next prompt. If it is not there, manually activate your environment with the command:

conda activate streamlitenv


In your terminal, type:

streamlit run app.py


If this doesn't work, use the long-form command:

python -m streamlit run app.py


Your app will automatically open in your browser. If it doesn't for any reason, open your browser and go to the localhost address indicated in your terminal, typically http://localhost:8501.

Change st.write to st.title and save your file:

import streamlit as st

st.title("Hello World")


In your browser, click "Always rerun" to instantly rerun your app whenever you save a change to your file. 

Your app will update! Keep making changes and you will see your changes as soon as you save your file. 

When you're done, you can stop your app with Ctrl+C in your terminal or just by closing your terminal.

What's next?

Read about our Main concepts and try out more commands in your app.

Use Community Cloud to develop with GitHub Codespaces

To use GitHub codespaces for Streamlit development, a properly configured devcontainer.json file is needed to set up the environment. Fortunately, Community Cloud is here to help! Although Streamlit Community Cloud is primarily used to deploy and share apps with the rest of the world, we've build in some handy features to make it easy to use GitHub Codespaces. This guide explains how to create a Community Cloud account and use an automated workflow to get you into a GitHub codespace and live-editing a Streamlit app. The automated workflow will fork our Streamlit Hello app to your GitHub account, deploy it, then open up a codespace for you to start editing. All this happens right in your browser, no installation required.

You will be signing in to your Google and GitHub accounts during this process. If you do not already have these accounts, you can create them before you begin. If you do not want to use a Google account, you can create your account with any email.

Sign up for Streamlit Community Cloud
Go to share.streamlit.io/signup.
Click "Continue with Google".
Enter your Google credentials and follow Google's authentication prompts.
After authenticating with Google, click "Connect GitHub account".
Enter your GitHub credentials and follow GitHub's authentication prompts.
Click "Authorize streamlit".
To finish, fill in your information and click "Continue" at the bottom of the screen.
You will be taken to your Streamlit workspace. If you see a warning icon (warning) next to "Settings" in the upper-right corner, this will be addressed in the next steps.
Create a new app with GitHub Codespaces
Click the down arrow (expand_more) to expand the options under "New App".
Click "Create new app with GitHub Codespaces".
You will be prompted that "Streamlit is requesting additional permissions". Click "Authorize streamlit".
The Streamlit Hello repository will be forked to your GitHub account. Fill in a repository name and click "Create!"
Click "Create new codespace" to confirm the creation of a codespace on your GitHub account. Read more about GitHub Codespaces the learn about monthly limits for free use and paid plans.
Wait for GitHub to set up your codespace.
GitHub will automatically execute the commands to launch your Streamlit app within your codespace. Your app will be visible in a "Simple Browser" on the right. This may take a minute to complete from when your codespace first appears on screen.
Edit your app in GitHub Codespaces
Go to the app's main file (Hello.py) and add some text to the title in st.write(). Try typing ":balloon:" at the beginning.
Files are automatically saved in your codespace with each edit. Click "Always rerun" in the upper-right corner of your app to automatically rerun with each edit.
See your edits and keep going!
Stop or delete your codespace

When you are done, remember to stop your codespace on GitHub to avoid any undesired use of your capacity.

Go to github.com/codespaces. At the bottom of the page, all your codespaces are listed. Click the overflow menu icon (more_horiz) for your codespace.

Click "Stop codespace" if you'd like to return to your work later. Otherwise, click "Delete."

Congratulations! You just deployed an app to Streamlit Community Cloud. üéâ Head back to your workspace at share.streamlit.io/ and deploy another Streamlit app.

Insert a multi-element container.

Inserts an invisible container into your app that can be used to hold multiple elements. This allows you to, for example, insert multiple elements into your app out of order.

To add elements to the returned container, you can use "with" notation (preferred) or just call methods directly on the returned object. See examples below.

Function signature
[source]

st.container(*, height=None, border=None)

Parameters

height (int or None)

Desired height of the container expressed in pixels. If None (default) the container grows to fit its content. If a fixed height, scrolling is enabled for large content and a grey border is shown around the container to visually separate its scroll surface from the rest of the app.

Note

Use containers with scroll sparingly. If you do, try to keep the height small (below 500 pixels). Otherwise, the scroll surface of the container might cover the majority of the screen on mobile devices, which makes it hard to scroll the rest of the app.

border (bool or None)

Whether to show a border around the container. If None (default), a border is shown if the container is set to a fixed height and not shown otherwise.

Examples

Inserting elements using "with" notation:

import streamlit as st

with st.container():
   st.write("This is inside the container")

   # You can call any Streamlit command, including custom components:
   st.bar_chart(np.random.randn(50, 3))

st.write("This is outside the container")
Copy

Inserting elements out of order:

import streamlit as st

container = st.container(border=True)
container.write("This is inside the container")
st.write("This is outside the container")

# Now insert some more in the container
container.write("This is inside too")
Copy

Using height to make a grid:

import streamlit as st

row1 = st.columns(3)
row2 = st.columns(3)

for col in row1 + row2:
    tile = col.container(height=120)
    tile.title(":balloon:")
Copy

Using height to create a scrolling container for long content:

import streamlit as st

long_text = "Lorem ipsum. " * 1000

with st.container(height=300):
    st.markdown(long_text)
Copy

Streamlit in Snowflake

Configure a link column in st.dataframe or st.data_editor.

The cell values need to be string and will be shown as clickable links. This command needs to be used in the column_config parameter of st.dataframe or st.data_editor. When used with st.data_editor, editing will be enabled with a text input widget.

Function signature
[source]

st.column_config.LinkColumn(label=None, *, width=None, help=None, disabled=None, required=None, default=None, max_chars=None, validate=None, display_text=None)

Parameters

label (str or None)

The label shown at the top of the column. If None (default), the column name is used.

width ("small", "medium", "large", or None)

The display width of the column. Can be one of "small", "medium", or "large". If None (default), the column will be sized to fit the cell contents.

help (str or None)

An optional tooltip that gets displayed when hovering over the column label.

disabled (bool or None)

Whether editing should be disabled for this column. Defaults to False.

required (bool or None)

Whether edited cells in the column need to have a value. If True, an edited cell can only be submitted if it has a value other than None. Defaults to False.

default (str or None)

Specifies the default value in this column when a new row is added by the user.

max_chars (int or None)

The maximum number of characters that can be entered. If None (default), there will be no maximum.

validate (str or None)

A regular expression (JS flavor, e.g. "^https://.+$") that edited values are validated against. If the input is invalid, it will not be submitted.

display_text (str or None)

The text that is displayed in the cell. Can be one of:

None (default) to display the URL itself.
A string that is displayed in every cell, e.g. "Open link".
A regular expression (JS flavor, detected by usage of parentheses) to extract a part of the URL via a capture group, e.g. "https://(.*?)\.streamlit\.app" to extract the display text "foo" from the URL "https://foo.streamlit.app".

For more complex cases, you may use Pandas Styler's format function on the underlying dataframe. Note that this makes the app slow, doesn't work with editable columns, and might be removed in the future.

Examples
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

data_df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "apps": [
            "https://roadmap.streamlit.app",
            "https://extras.streamlit.app",
            "https://issues.streamlit.app",
            "https://30days.streamlit.app",
        ],
        "creator": [
            "https://github.com/streamlit",
            "https://github.com/arnaudmiribel",
            "https://github.com/streamlit",
            "https://github.com/streamlit",
        ],
    }
)

st.data_editor(
    data_df,
    column_config={
        "apps": st.column_config.LinkColumn(
            "Trending apps",
            help="The top trending Streamlit apps",
            validate="^https://[a-z]+\.streamlit\.app$",
            max_chars=100,
            display_text="https://(.*?)\.streamlit\.app"
        ),
        "creator": st.column_config.LinkColumn(
            "App Creator", display_text="Open profile"
        ),
    },
    hide_index=True,

Streamlit in Snowflake

Programmatically switch the current page in a multipage app.

When st.switch_page is called, the current page execution stops and the specified page runs as if the user clicked on it in the sidebar navigation. The specified page must be recognized by Streamlit's multipage architecture (your main Python file or a Python file in a pages/ folder). Arbitrary Python scripts cannot be passed to st.switch_page.

Function signature
[source]

st.switch_page(page)

Parameters

page (str)

The file path (relative to the main script) of the page to switch to.

Example

Consider the following example given this file structure:

your-repository/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page_1.py.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page_2.py.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ your_app.py
Copy
import streamlit as st

if st.button("Home"):
    st.switch_page("your_app.py")
if st.button("Page 1"):
    st.switch_page("pages/page_1.py")
if st.button("Page 2"):
    st.switch_page("pages/page_2.py")

The AppTest class
Testing-element classes
App testing

Streamlit app testing framework enables developers to build and run headless tests that execute their app code directly, simulate user input, and inspect rendered outputs for correctness.

The provided class, AppTest, simulates a running app and provides methods to set up, manipulate, and inspect the app contents via API instead of a browser UI. It can be used to write automated tests of an app in various scenarios. These can then be run using a tool like pytest. A typical pattern is to build a suite of tests for an app that ensure consistent functionality as the app evolves, and run the tests locally and/or in a CI environment like Github Actions.

The AppTest class
st.testing.v1.AppTest

st.testing.v1.AppTest simulates a running Streamlit app for testing.

from streamlit.testing.v1 import AppTest

at = AppTest.from_file("streamlit_app.py")
at.secrets["WORD"] = "Foobar"
at.run()
assert not at.exception

at.text_input("word").input("Bazbat").run()
assert at.warning[0].value == "Try again."

AppTest.from_file

st.testing.v1.AppTest.from_file initializes a simulated app from a file.

from streamlit.testing.v1 import AppTest

at = AppTest.from_file("streamlit_app.py")
at.secrets["WORD"] = "Foobar"
at.run()
assert not at.exception

AppTest.from_string

st.testing.v1.AppTest.from_string initializes a simulated app from a string.

from streamlit.testing.v1 import AppTest

app_script = """
import streamlit as st

word_of_the_day = st.text_input("What's the word of the day?", key="word")
if word_of_the_day == st.secrets["WORD"]:
    st.success("That's right!")
elif word_of_the_day and word_of_the_day != st.secrets["WORD"]:
    st.warn("Try again.")
"""

at = AppTest.from_string(app_script)
at.secrets["WORD"] = "Foobar"
at.run()
assert not at.exception

AppTest.from_function

st.testing.v1.AppTest.from_function initializes a simulated app from a function.

from streamlit.testing.v1 import AppTest

def app_script ():
    import streamlit as st

    word_of_the_day = st.text_input("What's the word of the day?", key="word")
    if word_of_the_day == st.secrets["WORD"]:
        st.success("That's right!")
    elif word_of_the_day and word_of_the_day != st.secrets["WORD"]:
        st.warn("Try again.")

at = AppTest.from_function(app_script)
at.secrets["WORD"] = "Foobar"
at.run()
assert not at.exception

st.query_params
CONTENTS
st.query_params
Repeated keys
Limitation
st.query_params.get_all
st.query_params.clear
st.query_params.to_dict
st.query_params

st.query_params provides a dictionary-like interface to access query parameters in your app's URL and is available as of Streamlit 1.30.0. It behaves similarly to st.session_state with the notable exception that keys may be repeated in an app's URL. Handling of repeated keys requires special consideration as explained below. st.query_params can be used with both key and attribute notation. For example, st.query_params.my_key and st.query_params["my_key"].

Query parameters can be entered into your app's URL or programatically added through st.query_params. For example, the following URL and dictionary show the same key-value pairs:

https://your_app.streamlit.app/?first_key=1&second_key=two&third_key=true

{
    "first_key" : "1",
    "second_key" : "two",
    "third_key" : "true"
}



A key-value pair prefixed with ? is added to the end of your app's URL. Additional key-value pairs can be added. Each additional pair is prefixed with & instead of ?. All keys and values will be set and returned as strings. Query parameters are cleared when navigating between pages in a multipage app.

Repeated keys

When a key is repeated in your app's URL (?a=1&a=2&a=3), dict-like methods will return only the last value. In this example, st.query_params["a"] returns "3". To get all keys as a list, use the .get_all() method shown below. To set the value of a repeated key, assign the values as a list. For example, st.query_params.a = ["1", "2", "3"] produces the repeated key given at the beginning of this paragraph.

Limitation

st.query_params can't get or set embedding settings as described in Embed your app. st.query_params.embed and st.query_params.embed_options will raise an AttributeError or StreamlitAPIException when trying to get or set their values, respectively.

st.query_params.get_all(key)

Parameters

key (str)

The label of the query parameter in the URL.

Returns

(List[str])

A list of values associated to the given key. May return zero, one, or multiple values.

Streamlit in Snowflake

Get all query parameters as a dictionary.

This method primarily exists for internal use and is not needed for most cases. st.query_params returns an object that inherits from dict by default.

When a key is repeated as a query parameter within the URL, this method will return only the last value of each unique key.

Function signature
[source]

st.query_params.to_dict()

Returns

(Dict[str,str])

A dictionary of the current query paramters in the app's URL.

If for some reason that doesn't work, please try logging out and back in again to make sure the change took effect. And if that doesn't work - please let us know and we'll get you sorted!

It won't let me deploy the app

To deploy an app for the first time you must have admin-level access to the repo in GitHub. Please check with your administrator to make sure you have that access. If not, please ask them to deploy for the first time (we need this in order to establish webhooks for continuous integration) and from there you can then push updates to the app.

I need to set a specific Python version for my app

When deploying an app, under advanced settings, you can choose which version of Python you wish your app to use.

How do I store files locally?

If you want to store your data locally as opposed to in a database, you can store the file in your GitHub repository. Streamlit is just python, so you can read the file using:

pandas.read_csv("data.csv") or open("data.csv")

star
Tip

If you have really big or binary data that you change frequently, and git is feeling slow, you might want to check out Git Large File Store (LFS) as a better way to store large files in GitHub. You don't need to make any changes to your app to start using it. If your GitHub repo uses LFS, it will now just work with Streamlit.

My app is running into issues while deploying

Check your Cloud logs by clicking on the "Manage app" expander in the bottom right corner of your screen. Often the trouble is due to a dependency not being declared. See here for more information on dependency management.

If that's not the issue, then please send the logs and warning you are seeing to our Community forum and we'll help get you sorted!

My app is hitting resource limits / my app is running very slowly

If your app is running slowly or you're hitting the 'Argh' page, we first highly recommend going through and implementing the suggestions in the following blog posts to prevent your app from hitting the resource limits and to detect if your Streamlit app leaks memory:

Common app problems: Resource limits
3 steps to fix app memory leaks

If you're still having issues, click here to learn more about resource limits.

Can I get a custom URL for my app?

Yes! You can find instructions for setting a custom subdomain here.

Sharing and accessing apps

Don't have SSO? No problem! You can sign in to Streamlit with your email address. Click here for step-by-step instructions on how to sign in with email. */}

How do I add viewers to my Streamlit apps?

Viewer auth allows you to restrict the viewers of your private app. To access your app, users have to authenticate using an email-based passwordless login or Google OAuth. To learn more about how to share your public and private apps with viewers, click here.

Do viewers need access to the GitHub repo?

Nope! You only need access to the GitHub repo if you want to push changes to the app.

What will unauthorized/logged out viewers see when they view my app?

A 404 error is displayed to unauthorized viewers to avoid providing any unnecessary information about your app to unintended viewers. Users who satisfy any of the following conditions will see a 404 error when attempting to view your app after you have configured viewer auth:

User is not logged in with their primary identity.
User is not included in the list of allowed viewers provided in the app settings.
User lacks read access to your app's GitHub repo.
User has read access to your app's GitHub repo but is not enrolled in Streamlit Community Cloud.
I've added someone to the viewer list but they still see a 404 error when attempting to view the app

If a user is still seeing a 404 error after their email address has been added to the viewer list, we recommend that you:

Check that the user did not log into a different Google account via Single Sign-On (if you have added their work email address to the viewer list, ask the user to check that they are not logged into their personal Google account, and vice versa).
Check that the user has navigated to the correct URL.
Check that the user's email address has been entered correctly in the viewer list.
Reach out on our Community forum and we will be happy to help.
Data and app security
How will Streamlit secure my data?

Streamlit takes a number of industry best-practice measures to ensure your code, data, and apps are all secure. Read more in our Trust and Security memo.

How do I set up SSO for my organization?

Community Cloud uses Google OAuth, by default. If you use Google for authentication you're all set.

Billing and administration

The Community Cloud is a free service. You don't have to worry about setting up billing or being charged.

GitHub integration
Why does Streamlit require additional OAuth scope?

In order to deploy your app, Streamlit requires access to your app's source code in GitHub and also the ability to manage the public keys associated with the repositories. The default GitHub OAuth scopes are sufficient to work with apps in public GitHub repositories. However, in order to work with apps in private GitHub repositories, Streamlit requires the additional repo OAuth scope from GitHub. We recognize that this scope provides Streamlit with extra permissions that we do not really need, and which, as people who prize security, we'd rather not even be granted. Alas, we need to work with the APIs we are provided by GitHub.

After deploying my private-repo app, I received an email from GitHub saying a new public key was added to my repo. Is this expected?

This is the expected behavior. When you try to deploy an app that lives in a private repo, Streamlit Community Cloud needs to get access to that repo somehow. For this, we create a read-only GitHub Deploy Key then access your repo using a public SSH key. When we set this up, GitHub notifies admins of the repo that the key was created as a security measure.

What happens when a user's permissions change on GitHub?

Once a user is added to a repository on GitHub, it will take at most 15 minutes before they can deploy the app on Cloud. If a user is removed from a repository on GitHub, it will take at most 15 minutes before their permissions to manage the app from that repository are revoked.

Limitations and known issues

Here are some limitations and known issues that we're actively working to resolve.

When you print something to the Cloud logs, you may need to do a¬†sys.stdout.flush()¬†before it shows up.

Matplotlib¬†doesn't work well with threads. So if you're using Matplotlib you should wrap your code with locks as shown in the snippet below. This Matplotlib bug is more prominent when you share your app apps since you're more likely to get more concurrent users then.

from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import RendererAgg
_lock = RendererAgg.lock

with _lock:
  fig.title('This is a figure)')
  fig.plot([1,20,3,40])
  st.pyplot(fig)


All apps are hosted in the United States. This is currently not configurable.

Share your app

Now that your app is deployed you can easily share it and collaborate on it. But first, let's take a moment and do a little joy dance for getting that app deployed! üï∫üíÉ

Your app is now live at a fixed URL, so go wild and share it with whomever you want. Your app will inherit permissions from your GitHub repo, meaning that if your repo is private your app will be private and if your repo is public your app will be public. If you want to change that you can simply do so from the app settings menu.

You are only allowed one private app at a time. If you've deployed from a private repository, you will have to make that app public or delete it before you can deploy another app from a private repository. Only developers can change your app between public and private.

Make your app public or private
Share your public app
Share your private app
Make your app public or private

If you deployed your app from a public repository, your app will be public by default. If you deployed your app from a private repository, you will need to make the app public if you want to freely share it with the community at large.

Set privacy from your app settings

Access your App settings and go to the "Sharing" section.

Set your app's privacy under "Who can view this app." Select "This app is public and searchable" to make your app public. Select "Only specific people can view this app" to make your app private.

Set privacy from the share button

From your app at <your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app, click "Share" in the upper-right corner.

Toggle your app between public and private by clicking "Make this app public".

Share your public app

Once your app is public, just give anyone your app's URL and they view it! Streamlit Community Cloud has several convenient shortcuts for sharing your app.

Share your app on social media

From your app at <your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app, click "Share" in the upper-right corner.

Click "Social" to access convenient social media share buttons.

star
Tip

Use the social media sharing buttons to post your app on our forum! We'd love to see what you make and perhaps feature your app as our app of the month. üíñ

Invite viewers by email

Whether your app is public or private, you can send an email invite to your app directly from Streamlit Community Cloud. This grants the viewer access to analytics for all your public apps and the ability to invite other viewers to your workspace. Developers and invited viewers are identified by their email in analytics instead of appearing anonymously (if they view any of your apps while logged in). Read more about viewers in App analytics.

From your app at <your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app, click "Share" in the upper-right corner.

Enter an email address and click "Invite".

Invited users will get a direct link to your app in their inbox.

Copy your app's URL

You can convenitiently copy your app's URL from the share menu or from your workspace.

From your app click "Share" in the upper-right corner then click "Copy link".

From your workspace click the overflow menu icon (more_vert) then click "Copy URL".

Add a badge to your GitHub repository

To help others find and play with your Streamlit app, you can add Streamlit's GitHub badge to your repo. Below is an enlarged example of what the badge looks like. Clicking on the badge takes you to‚Äîin this case‚ÄîStreamlit's Roadmap.

Once you deploy your app, you can embed this badge right into your GitHub README.md by adding the following Markdown:

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://<your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app)

push_pin
Note

Be sure to replace https://<your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app with the URL of your deployed app!

Share your private app

By default an app deployed from a private repository will be private to the developers in the workspace. A private app will not be visible to anyone else unless you grant them explicit permission. You can grant permission by adding them as a developer on GitHub or by adding them as a viewer on Streamlit Community Cloud.

Once you have added someone's email address to your app's viewer list, that person will be able to sign in and view your private app. If their email is associated to a Google account, they will be able to sign in with Google OAuth. Otherwise, they will be able to sign in with single-use, emailed links. Streamlit sends an email invitation with a link to your app every time you invite someone.

priority_high
Important

When you add a viewer to any app in your workspace, they are granted access to analytics for that app as well as analytics for all your public apps. They can also pass these permissions to others by inviting more viewers. All viewers and developers in your workspace are identified by their email in analytics. Furthermore, their emails show in analytics for every app in your workspace and not just apps they are explicitly invited to. Read more about viewers in App analytics

Invite viewers from the share button

From your app at <your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app, click "Share" in the upper-right corner.

Enter the email to send an invitation to and click "Invite".

Invited users appear in the list below.

Invited users will get a direct link to your app in their inbox.

To remove a viewer, simply access the share menu as above and click the close next to their name.

Invite viewers from your app settings

Access your App settings and go to the "Sharing" section.

Add or remove users from the list of viewers. Click "Save".

You can Update your email or Delete your account entirely through Workspace settings.

When using Streamlit Community Cloud, you have two identities behind your account: a primary identity (Google or email) and source control (GitHub). Your primary identity allows other users to share private apps with you and grant you access to their analytics. Your source control identity allows you to deploy apps from GitHub repositories and manage them through your Streamlit Community Cloud workspace.

Access your workspace settings

To manage your account, sign in to share.streamlit.io and click "Settings" in the top right corner to access your workspace settings.

Manage your app

You can manage your deployed app from your workspace at¬†share.streamlit.io¬†or directly from <your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app. You can view, deploy, delete, reboot, or favorite an app.

Manage your app from your workspace

Streamlit Community Cloud is organized into workspaces, which automatically group your apps according to the corresponding GitHub repository's owner. Your workspace is indicated in the upper-right corner. You will have one workspace that matches your GitHub username and additional workspaces for any GitHub organization or user who has granted you access.

Additionally, if you have view-only access to an app, you will be able to see that app's workspace. When you do not have developer access to an app, your management options for that app will be restricted as shown in the following sections.

To deploy or manage any app, always switch to the workspace matching the repository's owner first.

At the top of your workspace, "Analytics" is a shortcut to App analytics and "Settings" links to your Workspace settings (not to be confused with App settings for each of your apps).

App overflow menus

Each app has a menu accessible from the overflow icon (more_vert) to the right.

Copy URL ‚Äî See Copy your app's URL
Edit ‚Äî See Edit your app with GitHub Codespaces
Favorite ‚Äî See Favorite your app
Analytics ‚Äî See App analytics
Reboot ‚Äî See Reboot your app
Delete ‚Äî See Delete your app
Settings ‚Äî See App settings

If you have view-only access to an app, options will be restricted in that app's menu.

Manage your app directly from your app

You can manage your deployed app directly from the app itself! Just make sure you are signed in to Streamlit Community Cloud then visit your app.

Streamlit Community Cloud logs

From your app at <your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app, click "Manage app" in the lower-right corner.

Once you've clicked on "Manage app", you will be able to view your app's logs. This is your primary place to troubleshoot any issues with your app.

You can access more developer options by clicking the overflow icon (more_vert) at the bottom of your Cloud logs. To conveniently download your logs, click "Download log".

Other options accessible from Cloud logs are:

Analytics ‚Äî See App analytics.
Reboot app ‚Äî See Reboot your app.
Delete app ‚Äî See Delete your app.
Settings ‚Äî See App settings.
Your apps ‚Äî Takes you to your app workspace.
Documentation ‚Äî Takes you to our documentation.
Support ‚Äî Takes you to our forums!
App menus

From your app at <your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app, you can always access your app's menu just like you can when developing locally. The option to deploy your app is removed, but you can still clear your cache from here.

Manage your app in GitHub
Update your app

Your GitHub repository is the source for the app, so that means that any time you push an update to your repo you'll see it reflected in the app in almost real time. Try it out!

Streamlit also smartly detects whether you touched your dependencies, in which case it will automatically do a full redeploy for you‚Äîwhich will take a little more time. But since most updates don't involve dependency changes, you should usually see your app update in real time.

Add or remove dependencies

You can add/remove dependencies at any point by updating¬†requirements.txt¬†(Python dependenciess) or¬†packages.txt¬†(Linux dependencies) and committing the changes to your repository on GitHub. This will cause Streamlit Community Cloud to detect there was a change in your dependencies and automatically trigger (re)installation.

It is best practice to pin your Streamlit version in¬†requirements.txt. Otherwise, the version may be auto-upgraded at any point without your knowledge, which could lead to undesired results (e.g. when we deprecate a feature in Streamlit).

App resources and limits
Resource limits

All Streamlit Community Cloud users have access to the same resources and are subject to the same limits (1 GB of RAM). If your app is running slowly or you're hitting the 'üò¶ Oh no.' page, we first highly recommend going through and implementing the suggestions in the following blog posts to prevent your app from hitting the resource limits and to detect if your Streamlit app leaks memory:

Common app problems: Resource limits
3 steps to fix app memory leaks

If your app exceeds its resource limits, developers and viewers alike will see 'üò¶ Oh no.'

If see 'üò¶ Oh no.' when viewing your app, first check your Cloud logs for any specific errors. If there are no errors in your Cloud logs you are likely dealing with a resource issue.

Developer view

If you are logged into a developer account for an app over its limits, you can access "Manage app" from the lower-right corner of the app to reboot it and clear its memory. "Manage app" will be red and have a warning icon (error).

App hibernation

All apps without traffic for 7 consecutive days will automatically go to sleep. This is done to alleviate resources and allow the best communal use of the platform! If you would like to keep your app awake, simply visit the app to create traffic or commit your app's repository, even if it's an empty commit!

If left alone your app will go to sleep at the 7 day mark. When someone visits the app after this, they will see the sleeping page:

To wake the app up, click "Yes, get this app back up!" This can be done by¬†anyone¬†who has access to view the app, not just the app developer!

You can see which of your apps are asleep from your workspace. Sleeping apps have a moon icon (bedtime) to the right.

Deploy your app

Streamlit Community Cloud lets you deploy your apps in just one click, and most apps will deploy in only a few minutes. If you don't have an app ready to deploy, fork or clone one from our App gallery ‚Äî you can find apps for machine learning, data visualization, data exploration, A/B testing and more. You can also fork and deploy samples straight from the New app button. Once you've deployed your app, check out how you can Edit your app with GitHub Codespaces.

push_pin
Note

If you want to deploy your app on a different cloud service, check out the Deploy Streamlit apps article in our Knowledge Base.

Add your app to GitHub

Streamlit Community Cloud launches apps directly from your GitHub repo, so your app code and dependencies need to be on GitHub before you try to deploy your app. For more information on how to specify dependencies, see App dependencies.

Your directory structure should look similar to this:

your-repository/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ your_app.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt


If you are including any custom Configuration or Theming, make sure your config file is saved relative to the root of your repo. Within your repo, your config file should be named .streamlit/config.toml.

your-repository/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .streamlit/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ your_app.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt

priority_high
Important

Although you can deploy multiple apps from the same repository, there can be only one configuration file.

Deploy your app

From your workspace at share.streamlit.io, click "New app" from the upper-right corner of your workspace.

Fill in your repo, branch, and file path. As a shortcut, you can also click "Paste GitHub URL" to paste a link directly to your_app.py on GitHub.

An app URL with a random hash is prefilled but you can change this to a custom subdomain instead. In the example below, the app would be deployed to https://red-balloon.streamlit.app/. You can always change your subdomain later. See more about Custom subdomains at the end of this page.

Advanced settings for deployment
push_pin
Note

Streamlit Community Cloud supports all released versions of Python that are still receiving security updates. Streamlit Community Cloud defaults to version 3.9. You can select a version of your choice from the "Python version" dropdown in the "Advanced settings" modal. If an app is running a version of Python that becomes unsupported, it will be forcibly upgraded to the oldest, supported version of Python and may break.

(Optional) If you are connecting to a data source or want to specify the Python version for your app, you can do that by clicking "Advanced settings" before you deploy the app. Learn more about Secrets management.

Watch your app launch

Your app is now deploying and you can watch while it launches. Most apps take only a couple of minutes to deploy, but if your app has a lot of dependencies it may take longer to deploy the first time. After the initial deployment, any change that does not touch your dependencies should show up immediately.

push_pin
Note

The Streamlit Community Cloud logs on the right hand side of your app are only viewable to users with developer access to your repository. These logs help you debug any issues with the app. Learn more about Streamlit Community Cloud logs.

Your app URL

That's it ‚Äî you're done! Your app now has a unique subdomain URL that you can share with others. Read more about how to Share your app with viewers.

Unique subdomains

If the "Custom subdomain (optional)" field is blank when you deploy your app, a URL is assigned following a structure based on your GitHub repo. The URL begins with your GitHub username or organization owning your repo, followed by your repo name, app path, and a short hash. If you deploy from a branch other than main or master, the URL also includes the branch name.

https://[GitHub username or organization]-[repo name]-[app path]-[branch name]-[short hash].streamlit.app


For example, this is an app deployed from the streamlit organization. The repo is demo-self-driving and the app name is streamlit_app.py in the root directory. The branch name is master and therefore not included.

https://streamlit-demo-self-driving-streamlit-app-8jya0g.streamlit.app

Custom subdomains

Setting a custom subdomain makes it much easier to share your app since you can choose something memorable. Whether you set a custom subdomain during deployment or later, your app's URL will appear as:

https://<your-custom-subdomain>.streamlit.app


To view or customize your app subdomain from the dashboard:

Click the overflow icon (more_vert) to the app's right and select "Settings".
View the "General" tab in the App settings modal. Your app's unique subdomain will appear here.
Pick a custom subdomain between 6 and 63 characters in length for your app's URL and hit "Save".

It's that simple! You can then access your app by visiting your customized URL üéâ.

If a custom subdomain is not available (e.g. because it's already taken), you'll see an error message like this:

Start by finding the Component you'd like to use. Two great resources for this are:

The Component gallery
This thread, by Fanilo A. from our forums.

Install the Component using your favorite Python package manager. This step and all following steps are described in your component's instructions.

For example, to use the fantastic AgGrid Component, you first install it with:

pip install streamlit-aggrid


In your Python code, import the Component as described in its instructions. For AgGrid, this step is:

from st_aggrid import AgGrid


...now you're ready to use it! For AgGrid, that's:

AgGrid(my_dataframe)

Making your own Component

If you're interested in making your own component, check out the following resources:

>>>        return myconn.connect(**self._secrets, **kwargs)
>>>    def query(self, query):
>>>       return self._instance.query(query)

Optimize performance
Cache data objects
# E.g. Dataframe computation, storing downloaded data, etc.
>>> @st.cache_data
... def foo(bar):
...   # Do something expensive and return data
...   return data
# Executes foo
>>> d1 = foo(ref1)
# Does not execute foo
# Returns cached item by value, d1 == d2
>>> d2 = foo(ref1)
# Different arg, so function foo executes
>>> d3 = foo(ref2)
# Clear all cached entries for this function
>>> foo.clear()
# Clear values from *all* in-memory or on-disk cached functions
>>> st.cache_data.clear()

Cache global resources
# E.g. TensorFlow session, database connection, etc.
>>> @st.cache_resource
... def foo(bar):
...   # Create and return a non-data object
...   return session
# Executes foo
>>> s1 = foo(ref1)
# Does not execute foo
# Returns cached item by reference, s1 == s2
>>> s2 = foo(ref1)
# Different arg, so function foo executes
>>> s3 = foo(ref2)
# Clear all cached entries for this function
>>> foo.clear()
# Clear all global resources from cache
>>> st.cache_resource.clear()

Deprecated caching
>>> @st.cache
... def foo(bar):
...   # Do something expensive in here...
...   return data
>>> # Executes foo
>>> d1 = foo(ref1)
>>> # Does not execute foo
>>> # Returns cached item by reference, d1 == d2
>>> d2 = foo(ref1)
>>> # Different arg, so function foo executes
>>> d3 = foo(ref2)

Display progress and status
# Show a spinner during a process
>>> with st.spinner(text="In progress"):
>>>   time.sleep(3)
>>>   st.success("Done")

# Show and update progress bar
>>> bar = st.progress(50)
>>> time.sleep(3)
>>> bar.progress(100)

>>> with st.status("Authenticating...") as s:
>>>   time.sleep(2)
>>>   st.write("Some long response.")
>>>   s.update(label="Response")

st.balloons()
st.snow()
st.toast("Warming up...")
st.error("Error message")
st.warning("Warning message")
st.info("Info message")
st.success("Success message")
st.exception(e)

Personalize apps for users
# Show different content based on the user's email address.
>>> if st.user.email == "jane@email.com":
>>>    display_jane_content()
>>> elif st.user.email == "adam@foocorp.io":
>>>    display_adam_content()
>>> else:
>>>    st.write("Please contact us to get access!")

üìù Add stateful behaviors through the use of query parameters with st.experimental_set_query_params and st.experimental_get_query_params. Thanks @zhaoooyue!
üêº Improved pandas dataframe support for st.radio, st.selectbox, and st.multiselect.
üõë Break out of your Streamlit app with st.stop.
üñº Inline SVG support for st.image.

Callouts:

üö®Deprecation Warning: The st.image parameter format has been renamed to output_format.
Version 0.64.0

Release date: July 23, 2020

Highlights:

üìä Default matplotlib to display charts with a tight layout. To disable this, set bbox_inches to None, inches as a string, or a Bbox
üóÉ Deprecation warning for automatic encoding on st.file_uploader
üôà If gatherUserStats is False, do not even load the Segment library. Thanks @tanmaylaud!
Version 0.63.0

Release date: July 13, 2020

Highlights:

üß© Support for Streamlit Components!!! See documentation for more info.
üïó Support for datetimes in st.slider. And, of course, just like any other value you use in st.slider, you can also pass in two-element lists to get a datetime range slider.
Version 0.62.0

Release date: June 21, 2020

Highlights:

üì® Ability to turn websocket compression on/off via the config option server.enableWebsocketCompression. This is useful if your server strips HTTP headers and you do not have access to change that behavior.
üóùÔ∏è Out-of-the-box support for CSRF protection using the Cookie-to-header token technique. This means that if you're serving your Streamlit app from multiple replicas you'll need to configure them to to use the same cookie secret with the server.cookieSecret config option. To turn XSRF protection off, set server.enableXsrfProtection=false.

Notable bug fixes:

üñºÔ∏è Added a grace period to the image cache expiration logic in order to fix multiple related bugs where images sent with st.image or st.pyplot were sometimes missing.
Version 0.61.0

Release date: June 2, 2020

Highlights:

üìÖ Support for date ranges in st.date_picker. See docs for more info, but the TLDR is: just pass a list/tuple as the default date and it will be interpreted as a range.
üó£Ô∏è You can now choose whether st.echo prints the code above or below the output of the echoed block. To learn more, refer to the code_location argument in the docs.
üì¶ Improved @st.cache support for Keras models and Tensorflow saved_models.
Version 0.60.0

Release date: May 18, 2020

Highlights:

‚ÜïÔ∏è Ability to set the height of an st.text_area with the height argument (expressed in pixels). See docs for more.
üî° Ability to set the maximimum number of characters allowed in st.text_area or st.text_input. Check out the max_chars argument in the docs.
üó∫Ô∏è Better DeckGL support for the H3 geospatial indexing system. So now you can use things like H3HexagonLayer in st.pydeck_chart.
üì¶ Improved @st.cache support for PyTorch TensorBase and Model.
Version 0.59.0

Release date: May 05, 2020

Highlights:

Highlights:

üíº Made st.selectbox filtering case-insensitive.
„à¨ Better support for Tensorflow sessions in @st.cache.
üìä Changed behavior of st.pyplot to auto-clear the figure only when using the global Matplotlib figure (i.e. only when calling st.pyplot() rather than st.pyplot(fig)).
Version 0.57.0

Release date: March 26, 2020

Highlights:

‚è≤Ô∏è Ability to set expiration options for @st.cache'ed functions by setting the max_entries and ttl arguments. See docs.
üÜô Improved the machinery behind st.file_uploader, so it's much more performant now! Also increased the default upload limit to 200MB (configurable via server.max_upload_size).
üîí The server.address config option now binds the server to that address for added security.
üìÑ Even more details added to error messages for @st.cache for easier debugging.
Version 0.56.0

Release date: February 15, 2020

Highlights:

üìÑ Improved error messages for st.cache. The errors now also point to the new caching docs we just released. Read more here!

Breaking changes:

üêç As announced last month, Streamlit no longer supports Python 2. To use Streamlit you'll need Python 3.5 or above.
Version 0.55.0

Release date: February 4, 2020

Highlights:

üì∫ Ability to record screencasts directly from Streamlit! This allows you to easily record and share explanations about your models, analyses, data, etc. Just click ‚ò∞ then "Record a screencast". Give it a try!
Version 0.54.0

Release date: January 29, 2020

Highlights:

‚å®Ô∏è Support for password fields! Just pass type="password" to st.text_input().

Notable fixes:

‚ú≥Ô∏è Numerous st.cache improvements, including better support for complex objects.
üó£Ô∏è Fixed cross-talk in sidebar between multiple users.

Breaking changes:

If you're using the SessionState hack Gist, you should re-download it! Depending on which hack you're using, here are some links to save you some time:
SessionState.py
st_state_patch.py
Version 0.53.0

Release date: January 14, 2020

Highlights:

üó∫Ô∏è Support for all DeckGL features! Just use Pydeck instead of st.deck_gl_chart. To do that, simply pass a PyDeck object to st.pydeck_chart, st.write, or magic.

Note that as a preview release things may change in the near future. Looking forward to hearing input from the community before we stabilize the API!

The goals is for this to replace st.deck_gl_chart, since it is does everything the old API did and much more!

üÜï Better handling of Streamlit upgrades while developing. We now auto-reload the browser tab if the app it is displaying uses a newer version of Streamlit than the one the tab is running.

üëë New favicon, with our new logo!

Notable fixes:

Magic now works correctly in Python 3.8. It no longer causes docstrings to render in your app.

Breaking changes:

Updated how we calculate the default width and height of all chart types. We now leave chart sizing up to your charting library itself, so please refer to the library's documentation.

As a result, the width and height arguments have been deprecated from most chart commands, and use_container_width has been introduced everywhere to allow you to make charts fill as much horizontal space as possible (this used to be the default).

Version 0.52.0

Release date: December 20, 2019

Highlights:

üì§ Preview release of the file uploader widget. To try it out just call st.file_uploader!

Note that as a preview release things may change in the near future. Looking forward to hearing input from the community before we stabilize the API!

üëã Support for emoji codes in st.write and st.markdown! Try it out with st.write("Hello :wave:").

Breaking changes:

üßπ st.pyplot now clears figures by default, since that's what you want 99% of the time. This allows you to create two or more Matplotlib charts without having to call pyplot.clf every time. If you want to turn this behavior off, use st.pyplot(clear_figure=False)
üì£ st.cache no longer checks for input mutations. This is the first change of our ongoing effort to simplify the caching system and prepare Streamlit for the launch of other caching primitives like Session State!
Version 0.51.0

Release date: November 30, 2019

Highlights:

üêï You can now tweak the behavior of the file watcher with the config option server.fileWatcherType. Use it to switch between:
auto (default) : Streamlit will attempt to use the watchdog module, and falls back to polling if watchdog is not available.
watchdog : Force Streamlit to use the watchdog module.
poll : Force Streamlit to always use polling.
none : Streamlit will not watch files.

Notable bug fixes:

Fix the "keyPrefix" option in static report sharing #724
Add support for getColorX and getTargetColorX to DeckGL Chart #718
Fixing Tornado on Windows + Python 3.8 #682
Fall back on webbrowser if xdg-open is not installed on Linux #701

üåÑ You can now set config options using environment variables. For example, export STREAMLIT_SERVER_PORT=9876.
üê± Ability to call streamlit run directly with Github and Gist URLs. No need to grab the "raw" URL first!
üìÉ Cleaner exception stack traces. We now remove all Streamlit-specific code from stack traces originating from the user's app.
Version 0.49.0

Release date: October 23, 2019

Highlights:

üíØ New input widget for entering numbers with the keyboard: st.number_input()
üì∫ Audio/video improvements: ability to load from a URL, to embed YouTube videos, and to set the start position.
ü§ù You can now (once again) share static snapshots of your apps to S3! See the S3 section of streamlit config show to set it up. Then share from top-right menu.
‚öôÔ∏è Use server.baseUrlPath config option to set Streamlit's URL to something like http://domain.com/customPath.

Notable bug fixes:

Fixes numerous Windows bugs, including Issues #339 and #401.
Version 0.48.0

Release date: October 12, 2019

Highlights:

üîß Ability to set config options as command line flags or in a local config file.
‚ÜïÔ∏è You can now maximize charts and images!
‚ö° Streamlit is now much faster when writing data in quick succession to your app.

üéõÔ∏è Improved handling of widget state when Python file is modified.
üôà Improved HTML support in st.write and st.markdown. HTML is still unsafe, though!

Notable bug fixes:

Fixes @st.cache bug related to having your Python environment on current working directory. Issue #242
Fixes loading of root url / on Windows. Issue #244
Version 0.47.0

Release date: October 1, 2019

Highlights:

üåÑ New hello.py showing off 4 glorious Streamlit apps. Try it out!
üîÑ Streamlit now automatically selects an unused port when 8501 is already in use.
üéÅ Sidebar support is now out of beta! Just start any command with st.sidebar. instead of st.
‚ö° Performance improvements: we added a cache to our websocket layer so we no longer re-send data to the browser when it hasn't changed between runs
üìà Our "native" charts st.line_chart, st.area_chart and st.bar_chart now use Altair behind the scenes
üî´ Improved widgets: custom st.slider labels; default values in multiselect
üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The filesystem watcher now ignores hidden folders and virtual environments
üíÖ Plus lots of polish around caching and widget state management

Breaking change:

üõ°Ô∏è We have temporarily disabled support for sharing static "snapshots" of Streamlit apps. Now that we're no longer in a limited-access beta, we need to make sure sharing is well thought through and abides by laws like the DMCA. But we're working on a solution!
Version 0.46.0

Release date: September 19, 2019

Highlights:

‚ú® Magic commands! Use st.write without typing st.write. See https://docs.streamlit.io/en/latest/api.html#magic-commands
üéõÔ∏è New st.multiselect widget.
üêç Fixed numerous install issues so now you can use pip install streamlit even in Conda! We've therefore deactivated our Conda repo.

üêá We now cache JS files in your browser for faster loading
‚õî Improvements to error-handling inside Streamlit apps
Version 0.41.0

Release date: June 24, 2019

Highlights:

üìà Greatly improved our support for named datasets in Vega-Lite and Altair
üôÑ Added ability to ignore certain folders when watching for file changes. See the server.folderWatchBlacklist config option.
‚òî More robust against syntax errors on the user's script and imported modules
Version 0.40.0

Release date: June 10, 2019

Highlights:

Streamlit is more than 10x faster. Just save and watch your analyses update instantly.
We changed how you run Streamlit apps: $ streamlit run your_script.py [script args]
Unlike the previous versions of Streamlit, streamlit run [script] [script args] creates a server (now you don't need to worry if the proxy is up). To kill the server, all you need to do is hit Ctrl+c.

Why is this so much faster?

Now, Streamlit keeps a single Python session running until you kill the server. This means that Streamlit can re-run your code without kicking off a new process; imported libraries are cached to memory. An added bonus is that st.cache now caches to memory instead of to disk.

What happens if I run Streamlit the old way?

If you run $ python your_script.py the script will execute from top to bottom, but won't produce a Streamlit app.

What are the limitations of the new architecture?

To switch Streamlit apps, first you have to kill the Streamlit server with Ctrl-c. Then, you can use streamlit run to generate the next app.
Streamlit only works when used inside Python files, not interactively from the Python REPL.

What else do I need to know?

The strings we print to the command line when liveSave is on have been cleaned up. You may need to adjust any RegEx that depends on those.

A number of config options have been renamed:

Old config	New config
proxy.isRemote	server.headless
proxy.liveSave	server.liveSave
proxy.runOnSave	server.runOnSave
proxy.watchFileSystem	server.runOnSave
proxy.enableCORS	server.enableCORS
proxy.port	server.port
browser.proxyAddress	browser.serverAddress
browser.proxyPort	browser.serverPort
client.waitForProxySecs	n/a
client.throttleSecs	n/a
client.tryToOutliveProxy	n/a
client.proxyAddress	n/a
client.proxyPort	n/a
proxy.autoCloseDelaySecs	n/a
proxy.reportExpirationSecs	n/a

What if something breaks?

If the new Streamlit isn't working, please let us know by Slack or email. You can downgrade at any time with these commands:

pip install --upgrade streamlit==0.37

conda install streamlit=0.37


What's next?

Thank you for staying with us on this journey! This version of Streamlit lays the foundation for interactive widgets, a new feature of Streamlit we're really excited to share with you in the next few months.

Advanced features

This section gives you background on how different parts of Streamlit work.

‚ãÆ App menu

Streamlit provides a configurable menu within your app to access convenient tools for developers and viewers. These options can modify the appearance of your app while running.

Modify your app's theme while running
Record a screencast of your app
Deploy a local app to Streamlit Community Cloud
Customize or hide the app menu
Command-line options

When you install Streamlit, a command-line (CLI) tool gets installed as well. The purpose of this tool is to run Streamlit apps, change Streamlit configuration options, and help you diagnose and fix issues.

What is the command-line interface (CLI)?
How to run Streamlit apps from the CLI?
View Streamlit version from the CLI?
View documentation from the CLI
Clear cache from the CLI
Streamlit configuration

Streamlit provides four different ways to set configuration options. Learn how to use each of them to change the behavior of Streamlit.

How to set configuration options?
Opt out of telemetry collection
View all configuration options
Theming

This section provides examples of how Streamlit page elements are affected by the various theme config options.

base
Caching

The Streamlit cache allows your app to stay performant even when loading data from the web, manipulating large datasets, or performing expensive computations. To cache a function in Streamlit, you need to decorate it with one of two decorators: st.cache_data and st.cache_resource.

Minimal example
Basic usage
st.cache_data
st.cache_resource
Deciding which caching decorator to use
Advanced usage
Excluding input parameters
Controlling cache size and duration
Customizing the spinner
Using Streamlit commands in cached functions
Mutation and concurrency issues
Migrating from st.cache
Add statefulness to apps

Session State is a way to share variables between reruns, for each user session. In addition to the ability to store and persist state, Streamlit also exposes the ability to manipulate state using Callbacks.

What is Session State?
How to initialize Session State items?
How to read and update Session State items?
How to use callbacks in Session State?
How to use args and kwargs in callbacks?
How to use callbacks in forms?
How is Session State related to Widget State?
Caveats and limitations
Pre-release features

At Streamlit, we like to move quick while keeping things stable. In our latest effort to move even faster without sacrificing stability, we're offering our bold and fearless users two ways to try out Streamlit's bleeding-edge features.

Experimental features
Nightly releases
Secrets management

This section provides examples of how to use secrets management to store and retrieve sensitive information in your Streamlit app.

Develop locally and set up secrets
Use secrets in your app
Error handling
Use secrets on Streamlit Community Cloud
Working with timezones

Working with timezones can be tricky. This section provides a high-level description of how to handle timezones in Streamlit to avoid unexpected behavior.

Overview
How Streamlit handles timezones
datetime instance without a timezone (naive)
datetime instance with a timezone
Advanced notes on widget behavior

Widgets are magical and often work how you want. But they can have surprising behavior in some situations. This section provides is a high-level, abstract description of widget behavior, including some common edge-cases.

Summary for experts
Installation steps for the rest of us
Installation

There are multiple ways to set up your development environment and install Streamlit. Read below to understand these options. Developing locally with Python installed on your own computer is the most common scenario.

Summary for experts
Set up your Python development environment.
Run:
pip install streamlit

Validate the installation by running our Hello app:
streamlit hello

Jump to our Main concepts.
Installation steps for the rest of us
Option 1: I'm comfortable with the command line

Install Streamlit on your own machine using tools like venv and pip.

Option 2: I prefer a graphical interface

Install Streamlit using the Anaconda Distribution graphical user interface. This is also the best approach if you're on Windows or don't have Python set up.

Option 3: I'd rather use a cloud-based environment

Use Streamlit Community Cloud with GitHub Codespaces so you don't have to go through the trouble of installing Python and setting up an environment.
