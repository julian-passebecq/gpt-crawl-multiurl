multi url v0.1 08feb2024
made by julianp

don't use config ts for the url to scrawl, only modify json name in config.ts
put the url to crawl in tocrawl.csv

optional
put all url in allcrawl.csv
use crawlee.py to select which url you want to put in tocrawl.csv
why ? because i didn't modify config.ts, so the name given to the json is static
use txt.py to convert your json in txt for custom gpt input, might have better performance
