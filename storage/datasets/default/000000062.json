Visit your API Keys page to retrieve the API key you'll use in your requests.\n\nRemember that your API key is a secret! Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps). Production requests must be routed through your own backend server where your API key can be securely loaded from an environment variable or key management service.\n\nAll API requests should include your API key in an Authorization HTTP header as follows:\n\nAuthorization: Bearer OPENAI_API_KEY\nOrganization (optional)\n\nFor users who belong to multiple organizations, you can pass a header to specify which organization is used for an API request. Usage from these API requests will count as usage for the specified organization.\n\nExample curl command:\n\n1\n2\n3\n\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"OpenAI-Organization: YOUR_ORG_ID\"\n\nExample with the openai Python package:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI(\n  organization='YOUR_ORG_ID',\n)\n\nExample with the openai Node.js package:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  organization: 'YOUR_ORG_ID',\n});\n\nOrganization IDs can be found on your Organization settings page.\n\nMaking requests\n\nYou can paste the command below into your terminal to run your first API request. Make sure to replace $OPENAI_API_KEY with your secret API key.\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -d '{\n     \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n     \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Say this is a test!\"}],\n     \"temperature\": 0.7\n   }'\n\nThis request queries the gpt-3.5-turbo model (which under the hood points to a gpt-3.5-turbo model variant) to complete the text starting with a prompt of \"Say this is a test\". You should get a response back that resembles the following:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n\n{\n    \"id\": \"chatcmpl-abc123\",\n    \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n    \"created\": 1677858242,\n    \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\",\n    \"usage\": {\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 13,\n        \"completion_tokens\": 7,\n        \"total_tokens\": 20\n    },\n    \"choices\": [\n        {\n            \"message\": {\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"content\": \"\\n\\nThis is a test!\"\n            },\n            \"logprobs\": null,\n            \"finish_reason\": \"stop\",\n            \"index\": 0\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\nNow that you've generated your first chat completion, let's break down the response object. We can see the finish_reason is stop which means the API returned the full chat completion generated by the model without running into any limits. In the choices list, we only generated a single message but you can set the n parameter to generate multiple messages choices.\n\nStreaming\n\nThe OpenAI API provides the ability to stream responses back to a client in order to allow partial results for certain requests. To achieve this, we follow the Server-sent events standard.\n\nOur official Node and Python libraries handle Server-sent events for you. In Python, a streaming request looks like:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI()\n\nstream = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Say this is a test\"}],\n    stream=True,\n)\nfor chunk in stream:\n    if chunk.choices[0].delta.content is not None:\n        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end=\"\")\n\nIn Node / Typescript, a streaming request looks like:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nasync function main() {\n    const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n        model: \"gpt-4\",\n        messages: [{ role: \"user\", content: \"Say this is a test\" }],\n        stream: true,\n    });\n    for await (const chunk of stream) {\n        process.stdout.write(chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content || \"\");\n    }\n}\n\nmain();\nParsing Server-sent events\n\nParsing Server-sent events is non-trivial and should be done with caution. Simple strategies like splitting by a new line may result in parsing errors. We recommend using existing client libraries when possible.\n\nAudio\n\nLearn how to turn audio into text or text into audio.\n\nRelated guide: Speech to text\n\nCreate speech\n\nPOST\n \nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/audio/speech\n\nGenerates audio from the input text.\n\nRequest body\nmodel\nstring\nRequired\n\nOne of the available TTS models: tts-1 or tts-1-hd\n\ninput\nstring\nRequired\n\nThe text to generate audio for. The maximum length is 4096 characters.\n\nvoice\nstring\nRequired\n\nThe voice to use when generating the audio. Supported voices are alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, and shimmer. Previews of the voices are available in the Text to speech guide.\n\nresponse_format\nstring\nOptional\nDefaults to mp3\n\nThe format to audio in. Supported formats are mp3, opus, aac, and flac.\n\nspeed\nnumber\nOptional\nDefaults to 1\n\nThe speed of the generated audio. Select a value from 0.25 to 4.0. 1.0 is the default.\n\nReturns\n\nThe audio file content.\n\nExample request\ncurl\nSelect library\ncurl\npython\nnode\nCopy‍\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/speech \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"tts-1\",\n    \"input\": \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.\",\n    \"voice\": \"alloy\"\n  }' \\\n  --output speech.mp3\nCreate transcription\n\nPOST\n \nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions\n\nTranscribes audio into the input language.\n\nRequest body\nfile\nfile\nRequired\n\nThe audio file object (not file name) to transcribe, in one of these formats: flac, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, ogg, wav, or webm.\n\nmodel\nstring\nRequired\n\nID of the model to use. Only whisper-1 is currently available.\n\nlanguage\nstring\nOptional\n\nThe language of the input audio.

The prompt should match the audio language.\n\nresponse_format\nstring\nOptional\nDefaults to json\n\nThe format of the transcript output, in one of these options: json, text, srt, verbose_json, or vtt.\n\ntemperature\nnumber\nOptional\nDefaults to 0\n\nThe sampling temperature, between 0 and 1. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. If set to 0, the model will use log probability to automatically increase the temperature until certain thresholds are hit.\n\ntimestamp_granularities[]\narray\nOptional\nDefaults to segment\n\nThe timestamp granularities to populate for this transcription. Any of these options: word, or segment. Note: There is no additional latency for segment timestamps, but generating word timestamps incurs additional latency.\n\nReturns\n\nThe transcribed text.\n\nExample request\ncurl\nSelect library\ncurl\npython\nnode\nCopy‍\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\" \\\n  -F file=\"@/path/to/file/audio.mp3\" \\\n  -F model=\"whisper-1\"\nResponse\nCopy‍\n1\n2\n3\n\n{\n  \"text\": \"Imagine the wildest idea that you've ever had, and you're curious about how it might scale to something that's a 100, a 1,000 times bigger.

Example Python code.\n\nShow possible types\nmodel\nstring\nRequired\n\nID of the model to use. See the model endpoint compatibility table for details on which models work with the Chat API.\n\nfrequency_penalty\nnumber or null\nOptional\nDefaults to 0\n\nNumber between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.\n\nSee more information about frequency and presence penalties.\n\nlogit_bias\nmap\nOptional\nDefaults to null\n\nModify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.\n\nAccepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.\n\nlogprobs\nboolean or null\nOptional\nDefaults to false\n\nWhether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the content of message. This option is currently not available on the gpt-4-vision-preview model.\n\ntop_logprobs\ninteger or null\nOptional\n\nAn integer between 0 and 5 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. logprobs must be set to true if this parameter is used.\n\nmax_tokens\ninteger or null\nOptional\n\nThe maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion.\n\nThe total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length. Example Python code for counting tokens.\n\nn\ninteger or null\nOptional\nDefaults to 1\n\nHow many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the choices. Keep n as 1 to minimize costs.\n\npresence_penalty\nnumber or null\nOptional\nDefaults to 0\n\nNumber between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.\n\nSee more information about frequency and presence penalties.\n\nresponse_format\nobject\nOptional\n\nAn object specifying the format that the model must output. Compatible with GPT-4 Turbo and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models newer than gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.\n\nSetting to { \"type\": \"json_object\" } enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.\n\nImportant: when using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly \"stuck\" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if finish_reason=\"length\", which indicates the generation exceeded max_tokens or the conversation exceeded the max context length.\n\nShow properties\nseed\ninteger or null\nOptional\n\nThis feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the system_fingerprint response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.\n\nstop\nstring / array / null\nOptional\nDefaults to null\n\nUp to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.\n\nstream\nboolean or null\nOptional\nDefaults to false\n\nIf set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a data: [DONE] message. Example Python code.\n\ntemperature\nnumber or null\nOptional\nDefaults to 1\n\nWhat sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.\n\nWe generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.\n\ntop_p\nnumber or null\nOptional\nDefaults to 1\n\nAn alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.\n\nWe generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.\n\ntools\narray\nOptional\n\nA list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.\n\nShow properties\ntool_choice\nstring or object\nOptional\n\nControls which (if any) function is called by the model. none means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message. auto means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a particular function via {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"my_function\"}} forces the model to call that function.\n\nnone is the default when no functions are present. auto is the default if functions are present.\n\nShow possible types\nuser\nstring\nOptional\n\nA unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.\n\nfunction_call\nDeprecated\nstring or object\nOptional\n\nDeprecated in favor of tool_choice.\n\nControls which (if any) function is called by the model. none means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message. auto means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a particular function via {\"name\": \"my_function\"} forces the model to call that function.\n\nnone is the default when no functions are present. auto is the default if functions are present.\n\nShow possible types\nfunctions\nDeprecated\narray\nOptional\n\nDeprecated in favor of tools.\n\nA list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.\n\nShow properties\nReturns\n\nReturns a chat completion object, or a streamed sequence of chat completion chunk objects if the request is streamed.\n\nDefault‍\nImage input‍\nStreaming‍\nFunctions‍\nLogprobs‍\nExample request\ngpt-3.5-turbo\ngpt-3.5-turbo\ncurl\nSelect library\ncurl\npython\nnode.js\nCopy‍\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    \"messages\": [\n      {\n        \"role\": \"system\",\n        \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"role\": \"user\",\n        \"content\": \"Hello!\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }'\nResponse\nCopy‍\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n\n{\n  \"id\": \"chatcmpl-123\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"created\": 1677652288,\n  \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613\",\n  \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_44709d6fcb\",\n  \"choices\": [{\n    \"index\": 0,\n    \"message\": {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"\\n\\nHello there, how may I assist you today?\",\n    },\n    \"logprobs\": null,\n    \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n  }],\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 9,\n    \"completion_tokens\": 12,\n    \"total_tokens\": 21\n  }\n}\nThe chat completion object\n\nRepresents a chat completion response returned by model, based on the provided input.\n\nid\nstring\n\nA unique identifier for the chat completion.\n\nchoices\narray\n\nA list of chat completion choices.

Most developer should use our Chat Completions API to leverage our best and newest models.\n\nCreate completionLegacy\n\nPOST\n \nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/completions\n\nCreates a completion for the provided prompt and parameters.\n\nRequest body\nmodel\nstring\nRequired\n\nID of the model to use. You can use the List models API to see all of your available models, or see our Model overview for descriptions of them.\n\nprompt\nstring or array\nRequired\n\nThe prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.\n\nNote that <|endoftext|> is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt is not specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document.\n\nbest_of\ninteger or null\nOptional\nDefaults to 1\n\nGenerates best_of completions server-side and returns the \"best\" (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results cannot be streamed.\n\nWhen used with n, best_of controls the number of candidate completions and n specifies how many to return – best_of must be greater than n.\n\nNote: Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for max_tokens and stop.\n\necho\nboolean or null\nOptional\nDefaults to false\n\nEcho back the prompt in addition to the completion\n\nfrequency_penalty\nnumber or null\nOptional\nDefaults to 0\n\nNumber between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.\n\nSee more information about frequency and presence penalties.\n\nlogit_bias\nmap\nOptional\nDefaults to null\n\nModify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.\n\nAccepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this tokenizer tool to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.\n\nAs an example, you can pass {\"50256\": -100} to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated.\n\nlogprobs\ninteger or null\nOptional\nDefaults to null\n\nInclude the log probabilities on the logprobs most likely output tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if logprobs is 5, the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the logprob of the sampled token, so there may be up to logprobs+1 elements in the response.\n\nThe maximum value for logprobs is 5.\n\nmax_tokens\ninteger or null\nOptional\nDefaults to 16\n\nThe maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the completion.\n\nThe token count of your prompt plus max_tokens cannot exceed the model's context length. Example Python code for counting tokens.\n\nn\ninteger or null\nOptional\nDefaults to 1\n\nHow many completions to generate for each prompt.\n\nNote: Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for max_tokens and stop.\n\npresence_penalty\nnumber or null\nOptional\nDefaults to 0\n\nNumber between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.\n\nSee more information about frequency and presence penalties.\n\nseed\ninteger or null\nOptional\n\nIf specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result.\n\nDeterminism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the system_fingerprint response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.\n\nstop\nstring / array / null\nOptional\nDefaults to null\n\nUp to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.\n\nstream\nboolean or null\nOptional\nDefaults to false\n\nWhether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a data: [DONE] message. Example Python code.\n\nsuffix\nstring or null\nOptional\nDefaults to null\n\nThe suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.\n\ntemperature\nnumber or null\nOptional\nDefaults to 1\n\nWhat sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.\n\nWe generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.\n\ntop_p\nnumber or null\nOptional\nDefaults to 1\n\nAn alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.\n\nWe generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.\n\nuser\nstring\nOptional\n\nA unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse.
