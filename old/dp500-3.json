In an enterprise with many reports, every millisecond can improve the experience. By using Performance Analyzer, you can identify suboptimal report elements and adjust where possible.\n\nWhat is Performance Analyzer?\n\nPerformance Analyzer is a built-in feature in Power BI Desktop that measures how long report elements take to update and refresh, allowing you to see if certain elements are significantly slower.\n\nMonitor with Performance Analyzer\n\nIn Power BI Desktop, navigate to the View ribbon, then select Performance Analyzer. The Performance Analyzer pane will appear to the right of the canvas. When you're ready to interact with the report, select the Start Recording button, perform report actions like adjusting slicers, highlighting values, changing pages, etc. You can also Refresh visuals, and then Stop when you're done.\n\nSome easy ways to improve performance include:\n\nLimit visuals per page. If the entire page is slow to load, consider spreading visuals across multiple pages instead.\nRemove unnecessary columns and rows. For slower queries, review the data and determine if anything can be removed.\nSet data types. By default, Power BI will assume data types for imported columns, which should be verified, and all new columns must be manually set.\nApply most restrictive filters. More data will take more time to load, and isn't always the best user experience either. Consider limited results first, and allow drilling for more details.\n\n Tip\n\nThe best time to optimize your report is before sharing it with end-users as it allows you to improve performance before soliciting user feedback. However, improvement is a continual process and can and should be done regularly once the report is live as well. Stay informed with the Optimization guide for Power BI.\n\nNeed help?

As an enterprise report creator, it's up to you to use the available tools to create inclusive reporting across the organization.\n\n Note\n\nThis unit highlights some accessible design features, and more details including a checklist, can be found in the Power BI Documentation.\n\nConsider your audience\n\nEasily improve accessibility for most consumers with the following modifications:\n\nAlt text for visuals, shapes, and images\nSet tab order for visuals, shapes, and images\nConsistent font, colors, positioning\nColorblind-friendly color schemes\nUsing text or icons in addition to color\nAvoid jargon and acronyms\nSet sort order for visuals\nDisable auto-start videos and audio\nProvide captions and transcripts for videos and audio\nAvoid excess decorative shapes and images\nAlt text\n\nAlt text is one of the most helpful and easily configurable accessibility features. For all visuals, shapes, and images, you can add alt text - a description for use with screen readers.\n\nScreen readers will automatically read the title and type of visual, so add insight and context for low vision users, such as \"Total sales by category, further broken down by product\". If you want to include specific data points, instead of adding them to the static alt text, you can use DAX measures and conditional formatting to create dynamic alt text in enrich the user experience.\n\nTo set alt text, first select the visual or image, navigate to the Format visual/shape menu, and select Alt text. To add dynamic alt text, select the Fx button.\n\nSet tab order\n\nIn Power BI Desktop, you can set the tab order for how a keyboard user will experience your report. First, navigate to the View tab in the ribbon, then select Selection in the Show Panes section.\n\nYou'll see Layer order and Tab order, with a list of report elements. Layer order allows you to stack elements, whereas tab order dictates which item will be accessed next when the keyboard user tabs to the next item. Use the up/down arrows to set the order. Hide items by clicking the eye icon. This action will move the item to the bottom, remove the numbered position, and put a line through the eye to indicate hidden state.\n\n Tip\n\nSet tab order and turn off tab order (mark the item as hidden) on any decorative items.\n\nNext unit: Create custom visuals with R or Python\n\nContinue\n\nNeed help?

These allow individual consumers to make minor design changes to best understand the data themselves.\n\n Tip\n\nThis is a powerful feature for more advanced report consumers. Empower your users by sharing the Power BI Consumer Documentation for personalized visuals.\n\nWhat can consumers change\n\nReport consumers can make changes for the following items:\n\nVisualization type\nSwap measure or dimension\nAdd/remove legend\nCompare multiple measures\nChange aggregations\n\nConsumers can create a personal bookmark to save their changes after personalizing a report, and even share changes with others. Best of all, they can always reset to default to restore the report view.\n\nEnable personalized visuals\n\nYou can enable personalized visuals in Power BI Desktop or Power BI service.\n\nIn Power BI Desktop, go to File > Options and settings > Options > Current file > Report settings. Make sure Personalize visuals is turned on.\nIn Power BI service, go to Settings on the specific report, then toggle Personalize Visuals on, and Save.\n\nBy default, when you enable personalized visuals, it's enabled for all visuals in a report. You can modify each visual to allow personalization or not. You'll need to enable this setting for each report.\n\n Tip\n\nUse a Power BI Template (.PBIT) file to enable personalized visuals and add on top of your custom theme for faster report building in the future.\n\nFor more information and limitations, see the Power BI Documentation.\n\nNeed help?

Deploying an enterprise-wide custom theme provide consistency for:\n\nOrganizational branding\nAccessibility requirements\nAccess themes\n\nNavigate to the View tab on the ribbon, then select the drop-down arrow on Themes to:\n\nChoose a built-in theme\nBrowse for themes\nView the Theme gallery\nCustomize current theme\nSave current theme\nCreate your custom theme\n\nCurrently there are almost 20 built-in report themes, including high contrast and color-blind safe options. However, if you have a certain color palette and font family in mind, you can go to Customize current theme. From here, you can make changes in the following categories:\n\nTheme name and color settings include theme colors, sentiment colors, divergent colors, and structural colors (Advanced).\nText settings include font family, size, and color, which sets the primary text class defaults for labels, titles, cards and KPIs, and tab headers.\nVisual settings include background, border, header, and tooltips.\nPage element settings include wallpaper and background.\nFilter pane settings include background color, transparency, font and icon color, size, filter cards.\n\nAfter you make your changes, select Apply to save changes to your theme. Now you can use your theme for your current report and export for future use. Custom themes are an excellent choice for organizations, allowing a cohesive look for reports across entire department or organization.\n\nUsing the Customize current theme option is a quick and easy way to create a custom theme. If you want to make finer adjustments to themes you can also create a custom theme through JSON, which we don’t cover in this module.\n\nExport and import themes\n\nAfter you’ve applied changes to your custom theme, you need to go back to the Themes drop-down menu and select Save current theme to export the theme. A JSON file will be created that can be shared with others and used for any future reports. Now that your custom theme has been exported, you and others will need to import it to apply to other reports. Importing is as easy as exporting is – navigate to the Themes drop-down menu again, select Browse for themes, and choose the JSON file you just created (or that was shared with you). You'll get a notification when the theme successfully imports.\n\nEnterprise considerations\n\nAny changes made to this theme will need to be saved again to either overwrite the existing theme or as a new theme. Themes are local to the file as well, so changes made on someone’s copy on their computer won’t affect your copy. The theme could be saved as a Power BI Template (.PBIT) file, and then shared that way as well. When sharing custom themes, consider a business process to validate that the theme and/or template are being used.\n\n Tip\n\nOnce you’ve published your report, consider creating themes for your dashboard in the Power BI service.\n\nNeed help?

There's a tool for that! The Best Practice Analyzer (BPA) in Tabular Editor can be used during the development of tabular models in Power BI or Analysis Services models.\n\nDescribe Tabular Editor\n\nTabular Editor is an alternative tool for authoring tabular models for Analysis Services and Power BI. Tabular Editor 2 is an open-source project that can edit a BIM file without accessing any data in the model. Tabular editor enables users to easily manipulate tabular models and can be used in a few different ways. Tabular Editor can be used to:\n\nquickly edit data models\nautomate repetitive tasks using scripting\nincorporate DevOps with tabular models\nrun BPA rules\n\nThis unit focuses on using Tabular Editor to run the BPA to ensure you're implementing data modeling best practices as you build.\n\nDescribe the Best Practice Analyzer (BPA)\n\nBPA is a set of rules run in Tabular Editor that notify you of potential modeling missteps or changes that you can make to improve your model design and performance. It includes recommendations for naming, user experience, and common optimizations that you can apply to improve performance. For more information, see Best practice rules to improve your model's performance.\n\nBPA rules are a set of rules that you can add to your instance of Tabular Editor. When BPA rules are run on your tabular model, you'll get a list of rules that your model violates, and can fix them using Tabular Editor.\n\nBPA includes a set of pre-defined rules, and you can also define your own rules to encourage certain conventions and practices when developing tabular models.\n\nTo use the pre-defined BPA rules, download the BPA rules .json file from the GitHub repository. The rules are divided into categories for easier viewing, for example:\n\nPerformance\nDAX Expressions\nError Prevention\nFormatting\nMaintenance\n\nEach rule has a description, and many of the rules also have a reference article/video. Reading the rule description and article will provide context as to why the rule is important and why you should follow it.\n\n Note\n\nBPA rules can be run against tabular models in Power BI Desktop, SQL Server Analysis Services, Azure Analysis Services, or Power BI Premium.\n\nRun BPA in Tabular Editor\n\nInstall Tabular Editor.\n\nTabular Editor has an open-source and a paid version. This unit refers to use of the open-source version only.\n\nDownload the Best Practice Rules from GitHub.\n\nSave the file in C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Local\\TabularEditor and name it BPARules.json.\n\nIn Power BI Desktop, select Tabular Editor on the External Tools tab of the ribbon.\n\nTabular Editor will automatically connect to the data model\n\nOn the Tools tab, select Best Practice Analyzer.\n\nThe Best Practice Analyzer window will open, displaying any violations of the Best Practice Rules.\n\n Note\n\nThe best practice analyzer scans your model for issues whenever a change is made to the model. This is on by default but can be disabled.\n\nReview the objects in violation of the rules and fix them using Tabular Editor. For example, let's fix the columns violating the Don't summarize numeric columns rule, starting with the Weight column in the Product table.\n\nDouble select (or right select) the object to go to the object in Tabular Editor. Change the object properties as necessary. In this case, we're changing Summarize by from Sum to None.\n\nTo save your changes to back to the Model.bim file, select Save, or use the keyboard shortcut ctrl + s.\n\n Important\n\nTabular Editor uses the Tabular Object Model (TOM) to load and save metadata to and from Model.bim files. When fixing Best Practice rule violations, saving changes in Tabular Editor pushes modifications to the connected Power BI desktop data model.\n\nCustomize BPA for your organization\n\nBPA was designed to enable you to create custom rules and best practices for your organization. If the Best Practice Rules don't suit your needs, you can create rules required for data modeling best practices as you deem appropriate.\n\nYou can also edit existing rules, disable and ignore rules, and set severity levels for each rule. From the Best Practice Analyzer window, select Manage Best Practice Rules. This will enable you to turn rules to use in your scan on and off, edit rules, and delete rules. Edits you make to Best Practice Rules in this window will then be saved to the .json file.\n\nIncorporate the use of BPA into your Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process\n\nIf your organization has an established CI/CD process using Git, BPA can be integrated into your Azure Pipelines. If objects violate Best Practice Rules in the build, you can establish a process to either fail the build or proceed with warning based on the severity of the violation.\n\n Note\n\nThe severity level that you set for each rule while managing your best practice rules only comes into play when deploying models using the command line option in Tabular Editor.\n\nNext unit: Exercise: Use tools to optimize Power BI performance\n\nContinue\n\nNeed help?

Import performance data into DAX Studio, where you can view, sort, and filter all performance data. You can also bring a single query into the editor where you can make adjustments to the query to improve performance.\n\nUnderstand the VertiPaq engine\n\nBefore jumping into optimization, it's important to understand what's happening under the hood of Power BI. By using compression algorithms and a multi-threaded query processor, the Analysis Services VertiPaq engine delivers fast access to tabular model objects and data by Power BI.\n\nPower BI reads the content of your data source and transforms it in the internal VertiPaq columnar data structure, where each column is encoded and compressed. Dictionaries and indexes are created for each column. Finally, data structures are created for relationships and computation and compression of calculated columns occurs.\n\nDAX queries are being processed by two engines, the formula engine and the storage engine. We'll talk more about these engines below.\n\nDescribe DAX Studio\n\nDAX Studio is an open-source tool for executing DAX queries against Power BI and Analysis Services models. DAX Studio is useful for:\n\nReviewing the contents of your data model.\nWriting and optimizing complex DAX formulas and queries.\n\nDownload and install DAX Studio with the default settings, connect to your data model, and begin working on your queries. Once DAX Studio is installed, it can also be launched from the External Tools tab of the ribbon in Power BI desktop.\n\nOptimize the data model\n\nNow that you have an idea of how the VertiPaq engine works, let's discuss how you can use DAX Studio to optimize DAX queries that run in this environment.\n\nOptimize DAX queries\n\nCalculations using DAX, either measures or columns, are a part of a DAX query, which is processed by two engines in VertiPaq. When a query is processed, the formula engine processes the request, asks the storage engine for data, and performs necessary calculations. The storage engine retrieves and aggregates data requested by the formula engine.\n\nIn the diagram below, the DAX query is sent to the tabular model in steps 1 and 2. The request is then processed by the formula engine and sent to the storage engine, represented by step 3. In step 4, the storage engine either retrieves the data from the model and stores it in memory (for import mode), or passes the query on to the data source (for DirectQuery). For import mode, refreshing the data will retrieve the data from the source.\n\nTroubleshooting in DAX Studio enables you to see detailed statistics on the server timings of your query. You're able to view the proportion of time the query takes in each engine, and can then adjust your queries accordingly to improve performance.\n\nLet's talk through a scenario to understand how you can optimize a query using DAX Studio.\n\nYou have a report that contains a matrix visualizing 6 measures. Your CEO informs you that the visual is slow to render, and therefore the report is unusable. You start to dig in and confirmed slow render times using the Performance analyzer in Power BI desktop.\n\nYou then copy the query to look at it in DAX Studio to get more information on what might be causing your problem. In DAX Studio, you clear the cache(1), turn on the server timings (2), and then run the query (3).\n\nFrom top left to bottom right, the statistics tell you how many milliseconds it took to run the query, and the duration the storage engine (SE) CPU took. In this case, the formula engine (FE) took 73.5% of the time, while the SE took the remaining 26.5% of the time. There were 34 individual SE queries and 21 cache hits.\n\nFrom here, you can investigate what in your measures might be causing the issues. This requires deep DAX knowledge and is sometimes a case of trial and error.\n\nYou experiment with the measures and recognize that improving the sales measure by replacing complicated IF statements in DAX with variables and a time intelligence function. A safe way to experiment is to comment out measures and rework them. You can comment out measures by typing two forward slashes at the beginning of a line (//). For multi-row comments, use /* at the beginning of the comment and */ to close the comment.\n\nAfter experimenting, you clear the cache and run the query again with the updates you made to the measure. You find that your updated measure performs much better, with nearly a 50% reduction in query execution time.\n\n Important\n\nThe storage engine caches the results in memory for reuse. Because of this cache, it is critical to clear the cache prior to running queries in DAX Studio.\n\nView model metrics using VertiPaq Analyzer\n\nViewing the VertiPaq Analyzer Metrics in DAX Studio is a great way to get an overall view of what's going on in your data model. VertiPaq Analyzer reports the memory consumption of the data model and can be used to quickly identify where you're spending the most memory. In short - you can use VertiPaq Analyzer to make memory gobbling offenders obvious, rectify them in Power BI, and then rerun VertiPaq Analyzer to see the immediate benefits of your data model updates.\n\n Note\n\nThe VertiPaq engine only stores data in memory in import models. If you're using DirectQuery, the VertiPaq engine simply sends that query to the source. This means that viewing the VertiPaq Analyzer Metrics will only be helpful for import or composite models.\n\nYou can look at the size of the table, columns, etc., in bytes. The .pbix file further compresses these sizes - the displayed sizes in bytes are evaluated prior to compression.\n\nTo view model metrics, launch DAX Studio from the external tools tab of the Power BI ribbon and select View Metrics from the Advanced tab in DAX Studio.\n\nVertiPaq analyzer displays a number of important metrics about your model. We're going to focus specifically on memory consumption and cardinality. For a complete list of what each of these columns mean, consult the DAX Studio documentation.\n\nViewing metrics in DAX Studio helps you immediately find and fix problems. In this case, you can see that the problem is a column with high cardinality. You can then fix that issue back in Power BI, refresh the metrics, and immediately see the effects of your changes on the model.\n\nFor example, notice that the model in the image below contains a table that consumes 99.6% of the database memory. By drilling into the table, you can see that two columns, End date and Start date are gobbling up the most memory.\n\nTake a look at those two columns back in Power BI desktop and notice that they're Date/time columns. Date/time columns inherently have high cardinality due to all of the possible combinations of dates and times.\n\nUsing the VertiPaq Analyzer in DAX Studio can help you easily identify and eliminate columns with high cardinality (including auto Date/time and floating-point decimal data types), and identify and remove columns that aren't used for anything.\n\n Note\n\nRefer to the Power BI optimization guide for more detailed information on optimizing the data model.\n\nNext unit: Optimize a data model by using Best Practice Analyzer\n\nContinue\n\nNeed help?

The Performance analyzer helps you understand how report elements like visuals and DAX queries are performing.\n\nThe Performance analyzer helps you optimize at two of the four architecture levels, the data model and report visuals. The Performance analyzer is a great place to start when you're optimizing reports.\n\nUnderstand performance using Performance analyzer\n\nThe Performance analyzer displays and records logs that measure how each of your report elements performs when users interact with them. You can also see which aspects of their performance are most (or least) resource intensive. You can immediately see results, make changes, run the analyzer again, and see the impact of changes you've made.\n\nThe Performance Analyzer captures operations that occur in several major subsystems involved in executing a Power BI Report:\n\nReport Canvas provides the user interface for Power BI reports including hosting visuals and filters, managing user interactions for consuming and authoring reports, and retrieving data for display. The Report Canvas is written using web technologies and runs in web browsers or web browser components. The Report Canvas retrieves data using a high-level, internal, Power BI query language known as Semantic Query.\nData Shape Engine (DSE) evaluates Semantic Queries by generating and running one, or more DAX queries against a data model hosted inside Power BI, Power BI Desktop, Azure Analysis Services, or SQL Server Analysis Services.\nData Model Engine (AS) stores the data model and provides services to reports, such as DAX query evaluation. The model may be hosted in Power BI, Power BI Desktop, Azure Analysis Services, or SQL Server Analysis Services. Depending on the data model host, a model may be tabular or multidimensional. Tabular models may contain in-memory tables, Direct Query tables, or a mix of such tables. DAX queries against tables in Direct Query mode will trigger queries to the Direct Query data source. For example, a DAX query against a Direct Query table backed by a SQL Server database will trigger one, or more, SQL queries.\nUse Performance analyzer\n\nTo use the Performance analyzer, enable the Performance analyzer on the View tab of the ribbon, and select Start recording.\n\nAfter you start recording, take actions in the report. For example, move from one report tab to the next, select a slicer item, or interact with any of your visuals. Any actions you take in the report are displayed and logged in real time in the Performance Analyzer pane, in the order that the visual is loaded by Power BI.\n\nThe Performance analyzer is looking at the time it takes for each visual to query the data model and render results. This is the time from when a user does something on the page to when the visual is rendered, in milliseconds.\n\nIn the example below, three actions were taken after recording started.\n\nNavigated to a new report page\nChanged a slicer value\nCross highlighted a table\n\nEach visual's log information includes the time spent (duration) to complete the following categories of tasks:\n\nDAX query - if a DAX query was required, this is the time between the visual sending the query, and for Analysis Services to return the results.\nEvaluated parameters (preview) - time spent evaluating the field parameters within a visual. Learn more about field parameters (preview).\nVisual display - time required for the visual to appear on the screen, including time required to retrieve any web images or geocoding.\nOther - time required by the visual for preparing queries, waiting for other visuals to complete, or performing other background processing.\n\nAfter you've interacted with elements of the report you want to measure with Performance Analyzer, you can select the Stop button. The performance information remains in the pane after you select Stop for you to analyze.\n\nYou can select Refresh visuals in the Performance Analyzer pane to refresh all visuals on the current page of the report, which will gather information about all visuals.\n\nIf one particular visual appears to be performing slow, you can also refresh individual visuals. When Performance Analyzer is recording, you can select Analyze this visual found in the top-right corner of each visual, to refresh that visual, and capture its performance information.\n\n Important\n\nAs users interact with visuals in Power BI reports, DAX queries are submitted to the dataset and cached into memory. Because of this, you may need to clear the DAX query cache to get accurate results in the Performance analyzer. You can clear the cache by either closing and re-opening your report, or using DAX Studio.\n\nEvaluate performance data further\n\nThere are many different ways you can dig deeper into information recorded by the Performance analyzer.\n\nYou can use DAX Studio to investigate your queries in more detail by copying your query from the performance analyzer. After analyzing the query in DAX Studio, you can use your own knowledge and experience to identify where the performance issues are.\n\nIn the screenshot below, you can see that the DAX query in this table visual took 14 seconds. Users waited 14 seconds before seeing the results of the action that resulted in that query running, which in this case was a cross-highlight action. It's clear that this DAX needs to be optimized.\n\nTo analyze this query further, copy and paste the query into DAX Studio to repeat the execution of the query. In DAX Studio, you can activate more diagnostic tools using the Query Plan and Server Timings tracing options.\n\nFor DAX queries with long duration times, it's likely that a measure is written poorly or an issue has occurred with the data model. The issue might be caused by the relationships, columns, or metadata in your model, or it could be the status of the Auto date/time option.\n\nYou can also save Performance analyzer results by selecting the Export button, which creates a .json file containing results. Each event in the .json file contains timestamps, correlation information, and other metadata about the operation.\n\nYou can then load that data into DAX Studio to navigate through the performance metrics in more detail.\n\n Tip\n\nFor more information about the contents of the .json export file, see the Performance analyzer export file documentation.\n\nNext unit: Troubleshoot DAX performance by using DAX Studio\n\nContinue\n\nNeed help?

Object-level security (OLS) can restrict access to specific tables and columns, and their metadata. Typically, you apply OLS to secure objects that store sensitive data, like employee personal data.\n\nWhen Power BI enforces OLS, not only does it restrict access to tables and columns, but it can also secure metadata. When you secure metadata, it’s not possible to retrieve information about secured tables and columns by using Dynamic Management Views (DMVs).\n\n Important\n\nTabular models can hide tables and columns (and other objects) by using a perspective. A perspective defines viewable subsets of model objects to help provide a specific focus for report authors. Perspectives are intended to reduce the complexity of a model, helping report authors find resources of interest. However, perspectives aren’t a security feature because they don’t secure objects. A user can still query a table or column even when it’s not visible to them.\n\nConsider an example at Adventure Works. This organization has a data warehouse dimension table named DimEmployee. The table includes columns that store employee name, phone, email address, and salary. While general report consumers can see employee name and contact details, they must not be able to see salary values. Only senior Human Resources staff are permitted to see salary values. So, the data modeler used OLS to grant access to the salary column only to specific Human Resources staff.\n\nOLS is a feature inherited from Azure Analysis Services (AAS) and SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS). The feature is available in Power BI Premium to provide backward compatibility for models migrated to Power BI. For this reason, it’s not possible to completely set up OLS in Power BI Desktop.\n\nSet up OLS\n\nTo set up OLS, you start by creating roles. You can create roles in Power BI Desktop in the same way you do when setting up RLS. Next, you need to add OLS rules to the roles. This capability isn’t supported by Power BI Desktop, so you’ll need to take a different approach.\n\nYou add OLS rules to a Power BI Desktop model by using an XML for Analysis (XMLA) endpoint. XMLA endpoints are available with Power BI Premium, and they provide access to the Analysis Services engine in the Power BI service. The read/write endpoint supports dataset management, application lifecycle management, advanced data modeling, and more. You can use XMLA endpoint-enabled APIs for scripting, such as Tabular Model Scripting Language (TMSL) or the PowerShell SqlServer module. Or you can use a client tool, like SSMS. There are third-party tool options too, like Tabular Editor, which is an open-source tool for creating, maintaining, and managing models.\n\nBy default, all model tables and columns aren’t restricted. You can set them to None or Read. When set to None, users associated with the role can’t access the object. When set to Read, users associated with the role can access the object. When you’re restricting specific columns, ensure the table isn’t set to None.\n\nOnce you’ve added the OLS rules, you can publish the model to the Power BI service. Use the same process for RLS to map accounts and security groups to the roles.\n\nConsiderations\n\nIn a Power BI report, when a user doesn’t have permission to access a table or column, they'll receive an error message. The message will inform them that the object doesn’t exist.\n\nConsider carefully whether OLS is the right solution for your project. When a user opens a Power BI report that queries a restricted object (for them), the error message could be confusing and will result in a negative experience. To them, it looks like the report is broken. A better approach might be to create a separate set of models or reports for the different report consumer requirements.\n\nRestrictions\n\nThere are restrictions to be aware of when implementing OLS.\n\nYou can’t mix RLS and OLS in the same role. If you need to apply RLS and OLS in the same model, create separate roles dedicated to each type. Also, you can’t set table-level security if it breaks a relationship chain. For example, if there are relationships between tables A and B, and B and C, you can't secure table B. If table B is secured, a query on table A can't transit the relationships between table A and B, and B and C. In this case, you could set up a separate relationship between tables A and C.\n\nHowever, model relationships that reference a secured column will work, providing that the column’s table isn’t secured.\n\nLastly, while it isn’t possible to secure measures, a measure that references secured objects is automatically restricted.\n\nFor more information, see Object-level security.\n\nNeed help?

A role has a unique name in the model, and it usually includes one or more rules. Rules enforce filters on model tables by using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) filter expressions.\n\n Note\n\nBy default, a data model has no roles. A data model without roles means that users (who have permission to query the data model) have access to all model data.\n\n Tip\n\nIt's possible to define a role that includes no rules. In this case, the role provides access to all rows of all model tables. This role set up would be suitable for an admin user who is allowed to view all data.\n\nYou can create, validate, and manage roles in Power BI Desktop. For Azure Analysis Services or SQL Server Analysis Services models, you can create, validate, and manage roles by using SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT).\n\nYou can also create and manage roles by using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), or by using a third-party tool, like Tabular Editor.\n\nTo gain a better understanding of how RLS restricts access to data, watch the following animated image.\n\nApply star schema design principles\n\nWe recommend you apply star schema design principles to produce a model comprising dimension and fact tables. It’s common to set up Power BI to enforce rules that filter dimension tables, allowing model relationships to efficiently propagate those filters to fact tables.\n\nThe following image is the model diagram of the Adventure Works sales analysis data model. It shows a star schema design comprising a single fact table named Sales. The other tables are dimension tables that support the analysis of sales measures by date, sales territory, customer, reseller, order, product, and salesperson. Notice the model relationships connecting all tables. These relationships propagate filters (directly or indirectly) to the Sales table.\n\nThis model design supports examples presented in this unit.\n\nDefine rules\n\nRule expressions are evaluated within row context. Row context means the expression is evaluated for each row using the column values of that row. When the expression returns TRUE, the user can “see” the row.\n\n Tip\n\nTo learn more about row context, work through the Add calculated tables and columns to Power BI Desktop models module. While this module describes adding model calculations, it includes a unit that introduces and describes row context.\n\nYou can define rules that are either static or dynamic.\n\nStatic rules\n\nStatic rules use DAX expressions that refer to constants.\n\nConsider the following rule applied to the Region table that restricts data access to Midwest sales.\n\nDAX\nCopy\n\n'Region'[Region] = \"Midwest\"\n\n\n\nThe following steps explain how Power BI enforces the rule. It:\n\nFilters the Region table, resulting in one visible row (for Midwest).\n\nUses the model relationship to propagate the Region table filter to the State table, resulting in 14 visible rows (the Midwest region comprise 14 states).\n\nUses the model relationship to propagate the State table filter to the Sales table, resulting in thousands of visible rows (the sales facts for the states that belong to the Midwest region).\n\nThe simplest static rule that you can create restricts access to all table rows. Consider the following rule applied to the Sales Details table (not depicted in the model diagram).\n\nDAX\nCopy\n\nFALSE()\n\n\n\nThis rule ensures users can't access any table data. It could be useful when salespeople are allowed to see aggregated sales results (from the Sales table) but not order-level details.\n\nDefining static rules is simple and effective. Consider using them when you need to create only a few of them, as might be the case at Adventure Works where there are only six US regions. However, be aware of disadvantages: setting up static rules can involve significant effort to create and set up. It would also require you to update and republish the dataset when new regions are onboarded.\n\nIf there are many rules to set up and you anticipate adding new rules in the future, consider creating dynamic rules instead.\n\nDynamic rules\n\nDynamic rules use specific DAX functions that return environmental values (as opposed to constants). Environmental values are returned from three specific DAX functions:\n\nUSERNAME or USERPRINCIPALNAME – Returns the Power BI authenticated user as a text value.\n\nCUSTOMDATA - Returns the CustomData property passed in the connection string. Non-Power BI reporting tools that connect to the dataset by using a connection string can set this property, like Microsoft Excel.\n\n Note\n\nBe aware that the USERNAME function returns the user in the format of DOMAIN\\username when used in Power BI Desktop. However, when used in the Power BI service, it returns the format of the user's User Principal Name (UPN), like username@adventureworks.com. Alternatively, you can use the USERPRINCIPALNAME function, which always returns the user in the user principal name format.\n\nConsider a revised model design that now includes the (hidden) AppUser table. Each row of the AppUser table describes a username and region. A model relationship to the Region table propagates filters from the AppUser table.\n\nThe following rule applied to the AppUser table restricts data access to the region(s) of the authenticated user.\n\nDAX\nCopy\n\n'AppUser'[UserName] = USERPRINCIPALNAME()\n\n\n\nDefining dynamic rules is simple and effective when a model table stores username values. They allow you to enforce a data-driven RLS design. For example, when salespeople are added to, or removed from, the AppUser table (or are assigned to different regions), this design approach just works.\n\nValidate roles\n\nWhen you create roles, it’s important to test them to ensure they apply the correct filters. For data models created in Power BI Desktop, there’s the View as function that allows you to see the report when different roles are enforced, and different username values are passed.\n\nSet up role mappings\n\nRole mappings must be set up in advance of users accessing Power BI content. Role mapping involves assigning Microsoft Entra security objects to roles. Security objects can be user accounts or security groups.\n\n Tip\n\nWhen possible, it’s a good practice to map roles to security groups. That way, there will be fewer mappings, and you can delegate the group membership management to the network administrators.\n\nFor Power BI Desktop developed models, role mapping is typically done in the Power BI service. For Azure Analysis Services or SQL Server Analysis Services models, role mapping is typically done in SSMS.\n\nFor more information about setting up RLS, see:\n\nRow-level security (RLS) with Power BI\n\nRow-level security (RLS) guidance in Power BI Desktop\n\nUse single sign-on (SSO) for DirectQuery sources\n\nWhen your data model has DirectQuery tables and their data source supports SSO, the data source can enforce data permissions. This way, the database enforces RLS, and Power BI datasets and reports honor the data source security.\n\nConsider that Adventure Works has an Azure SQL Database for their sales operations that resides in the same tenant as Power BI. The database enforces RLS to control access to rows in various database tables. You can create a DirectQuery model that connects to this database without roles and publish it to the Power BI service. When you set the data source credentials in the Power BI service, you enable SSO. When report consumers open Power BI reports, Power BI passes their identity to the data source. The data source then enforces RLS based on the identity of the report consumer.\n\nFor information about Azure SQL Database RLS, see Row-level security.\n\n Note\n\nCalculated tables and calculated columns that reference a DirectQuery table from a data source with SSO authentication aren’t supported in the Power BI service.\n\nFor more information about data sources that support SSO, see Single sign-on (SSO) for DirectQuery sources.\n\nNext unit: Restrict access to Power BI model objects\n\nContinue\n\nNeed help?

You might restrict access because some report consumers aren’t permitted to view specific data, like sales results of other sales regions.

Calculation groups are made up of calculation items, which are simply DAX statements containing a substitute or placeholder for existing explicit measures in your model. For example, a calculation group, Time Intelligence, may contain the calculation items Year to Date, Quarter to Date, and Month to Date.\n\nCalculation group properties\n\nAnyone using calculation groups needs to be aware of the precedence property of a calculation group.\n\nPrecedence\n\nPrecedence is a property defined for a calculation group. When a data model contains more than one calculation group it's essential to define the precedence, or the order of evaluation.\n\nDefining the precedence ensures that the different calculation groups are executed in the proper order. A higher number indicates greater precedence, meaning it will be applied before calculation groups with lower precedence.\n\nAll calculation items within a single calculation group share the same precedence.\n\nUse Tabular Editor to set the precedence property for the calculation group.\n\nCalculation item properties\n\nCalculation items also contain properties that are important to report developers, including ordering and dynamic format strings.\n\nOrdering\n\nThe ordinal value is the sort order of the calculation item. The order in which calculation items appear in a report can be changed by specifying the Ordinal property. Specifying calculation item order with the Ordinal property doesn't change precedence, the order in which calculation items are evaluated.\n\nIf the ordinal value isn't specified, the default behavior is that calculation items are ordered alphabetically by name.\n\nDynamic format strings\n\nCalculation groups can also be used to define conditional format strings to a measure.\n\nA simple example of using dynamic format strings may be having a different format for totals compared to other values.\n\nDynamic format strings are particularly useful for currency conversion. For example, report consumers may want to see sales by country/region, with the correct currency formatting applied for each. This is accomplished by adding a format string column to the currency dimension table and then creating a currency conversion calculation group and item.\n\nNext unit: Create calculation groups in a model\n\nContinue\n\nNeed help?
