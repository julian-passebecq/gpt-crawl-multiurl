When result set caching is turned ON, running queries that return large result set (for example, >1GB) can cause high throttling on the control node and slow down the overall query response on the instance. Those queries are commonly used during data exploration or ETL operations. To avoid stressing the control node and cause performance issue, users should turn OFF result set caching on the database before running those types of queries.\n\nNext move back to the Power BI Desktop report and hit the Refresh button to submit the query again.\n\nAfter the data refreshes, hit Refresh once more to ensure we hit the result set cache.\n\nCheck the duration of the query again in Synapse Studio, in the Monitoring hub (1) - SQL Requests (2) page. Notice that now it runs almost instantly (Duration = 0s) (4).\n\nNext unit: Visualize data with serverless SQL pools\n\nContinue\n\nHaving an issue?

To improve the performance of applications and reports without adding any more cost, result-set caching and materialized views are second to none.\n\nResult-set caching\n\nResult-set caching helps with predictable and repetitive query patterns and enables instant query response times while reducing time-to-insight for data analysts and reporting users. Result-set caching is an effective solution for interactive dashboard performance improvement.\n\nWith result-set caching enabled, Azure Synapse Analytics automatically caches results from repetitive queries, causing subsequent query executions to return results from the persisted cache that omits complete query execution. In addition to saving compute cycles, queries satisfied by result-set cache do not use any concurrency slots and thus do not count against existing concurrency limits. For security reasons, only users with the appropriate security credentials can access the result sets in cache.\n\nMaterialized views to improve performance\n\nAnother feature that significantly enhances query performance for a broad set of queries is materialized view support. A materialized view improves complex queries' performance (typically queries with joins and aggregations) while offering simple maintenance operations.\n\nWhen materialized views are created, the Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL Pool query optimizer transparently and automatically rewrite user queries to leverage deployed materialized views, leading to improved query performance. Best of all, as the data gets loaded into base tables, the query optimizer automatically maintains and refreshes materialized views, providing easier maintenance and management. As the user queries use materialized views, queries run significantly faster and use fewer system resources. A materialized view pre-computes, stores, and maintains its data in a dedicated SQL pool just like a table. There's no recomputation needed each time a materialized view is used. That's why queries that use all or a subset of the data in a materialized view can get faster performance. The more complex and expensive the query within the view is, the more significant potential for execution-time savings.\n\nA properly designed materialized view provides the following benefits:\n\nReduce the execution time for complex queries with JOINs and aggregate functions. The more complex the query, the higher the potential for execution-time saving. The most benefit is gained when a query's computation cost is high and the resulting data set is small.\nThe optimizer in the dedicated SQL pool can automatically use deployed materialized views to improve query execution plans. This process is transparent to users providing faster query performance and doesn't require queries to make direct reference to the materialized views.\nMaterialized views require low maintenance. All incremental data changes from the base tables are automatically added to the materialized views in a synchronous manner. This design allows querying materialized views to return the same data as directly querying the base tables.\nThe data in a materialized view can be distributed differently from the base tables.\nData in materialized views gets the same high availability and resiliency benefits as data in regular tables.\n\nThe materialized views implemented in a dedicated SQL pool also provide the following additional benefits:\n\nComparing to other data warehouse providers, the materialized views implemented in Azure Synapse Analytics also provide the following additional benefits:\n\nAutomatic and synchronous data refresh with data changes in base tables. No user action is required.\nBroad aggregate function support. See CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW AS SELECT (Transact-SQL).\nThe support for query-specific materialized view recommendation.

Depending on how data is used, different data sources are available. There is a large number of varied data sources available for Power BI reports, encompassing:\n\nOnline services (Salesforce, Dynamics 365, others)\nDatabases (SQL Server, Access, Amazon Redshift, others)\nSimple files (Excel, JSON, others)\nOther data sources (Spark, Web sites, Microsoft Exchange, others)\n\nYou can connect to all sorts of different data sources when using Power BI Desktop or the Power BI service, and make those data connections in different ways. You can import data to Power BI, which is the most common way to get data, or connect directly to data in the original source repository, which is known as DirectQuery.\n\nImport connections\n\nYou can get data from any of the data sources in Power BI by selecting Get Data in the bottom-left corner of the page.\n\nAfter you select Get Data, you can choose the data you want to access\n\nFor import, when using Get Data in Power BI Desktop to connect to a data source like SQL Server, the behavior of that connection is as follows:\n\nDuring the initial Get Data experience, the set of tables selected each define a query that will return a set of data. Those queries can be edited before loading the data, for example, to apply filters, or aggregate the data, or join different tables.\nUpon load, all of the data defined by those queries will be imported into the Power BI cache.\nUpon building a visual within Power BI Desktop, the imported data will be queried. The Power BI store ensures the query will be fast. All changes to the visual are reflected immediately.\nAny changes to the underlying data aren't reflected in any visuals. It's necessary to Refresh to reimport data.\nUpon publishing the report as a .pbix file to the Power BI service, a dataset is created and uploaded to the Power BI service. The imported data is included with that dataset. It's then possible to schedule refresh of that data, for example, to reimport the data every day. Depending upon the location of the original data source, it might be necessary to configure an on-premises data gateway.\nWhen opening an existing report in the Power BI service, or authoring a new report, the imported data is queried again, ensuring interactivity.\nVisuals, or entire report pages, can be pinned as dashboard tiles. The tiles automatically refresh whenever the underlying dataset refreshes.\nDirectQuery connections\n\nFor DirectQuery, when using Get Data in Power BI Desktop to connect to a data source, the behavior of that connection is as follows:\n\nDuring the initial Get Data experience, the source is selected. For relational sources, a set of tables are selected and each still define a query that logically returns a set of data. For multidimensional sources, like SAP BW, only the source is selected.\nHowever, upon load, no data is imported into the Power BI store. Instead, upon building a visual within Power BI Desktop, queries are sent to the underlying data source to retrieve the necessary data. The time taken to refresh the visual depends on the performance of the underlying data source.\nAny changes to the underlying data aren't immediately reflected in any existing visuals. It's still necessary to refresh. The necessary queries are resent for each visual, and the visual is updated as necessary.\nUpon publishing the report to the Power BI service, it will again result in a dataset in the Power BI service, the same as for import. However, no data is included with that dataset.\nWhen opening an existing report in the Power BI service, or authoring a new one, the underlying data source is again queried to retrieve the necessary data. Depending upon the location of the original data source, it might be necessary to configure an on-premises data gateway, as is needed for import mode if the data is refreshed.\nVisuals, or entire report pages, can be pinned as Dashboard tiles. To ensure that opening a dashboard is fast, the tiles are automatically refreshed on a schedule, for example, every hour. The frequency of this refresh can be controlled, to reflect how frequently the data is changing, and how important it's to see the latest data. When opening a dashboard, the tiles reflect the data at the time of the last refresh, and not necessarily the latest changes made to the underlying source. You can refresh an open dashboard to ensure it's current.\nLive connections\n\nWhen connecting to SQL Server Analysis Services, there's an option to either import data from or connect live to, the selected data model. If you use import, you define a query against that external SQL Server Analysis Services source, and the data is imported as normal. If you use connect live, there's no query defined, and the entire external model is shown in the field list.\n\nNeed help?

You can create new reports or consume your existing Power BI datasets and reports, all within Synapse by simply linking your Power BI and Synapse workspaces. You can make any edits to your reports in Synapse and the changes will instantly propagate to all users. This tight integration between Power BI and Azure Synapse greatly reduces time to insights as Data Analysts, Data Scientists, Data Engineers and business users can collaborate easily in a single environment.\n\nA data warehouse is a centralized repository of integrated data from one or more disparate sources. Data warehouses store current and historical data and are used for reporting and analysis of the data. A Power BI linked service in Azure Synapse Analytics helps your reports access data in a data lake through serverless SQL pools or taps into tables in a dedicated SQL Pool quickly. This capability provides a large selection of data from multiple sources. Moreover, having the authoring tools in Azure Synapse Studio helps to craft the connection between data in the data lake or dedicated SQL pool much more intuitively.\n\nTo move data into a data warehouse, data is periodically extracted from various sources that contain essential business information. As the data is moved, it can be formatted, cleaned, validated, summarized, and reorganized with Azure Synapse Pipelines and Dataflows. Alternatively, the data can be stored in the lowest level of detail, with aggregated materialized views provided in Azure Synapse for reporting. In either case, Azure Synapse becomes a permanent data store for reporting, analysis, and business intelligence (BI), helping ‘align and combine’ data from multiple sources and enforcing consistent data standards when needed.\n\nNeed help?

A table is a set of columns that are used to store data, much like a table within a database. You can add and edit tables in your dataflow, and manage data refresh schedules, directly from the workspace in which your dataflow was created.\n\nDataflows are designed to support the following scenarios:\n\nCreate reusable transformation logic that can be shared by many datasets and reports inside Power BI. Dataflows promote reusability of the underlying data elements, preventing the need to create separate connections with your cloud or on-premises data sources.\n\nExpose the data in your own Azure Data Lake Gen 2 storage, enabling you to connect other Azure services to the raw underlying data.\n\nCreate a single source of the truth by forcing analysts to connect to the dataflows, rather than connecting to the underlying systems, providing you with control over which data is accessed, and how data is exposed to report creators. You can also map the data to industry standard definitions, enabling you to create tidy curated views, which can work with other services and products in Microsoft Power Platform.\n\nIf you want to work with large data volumes and perform ETL at scale, dataflows with Power BI Premium scales more efficiently and gives you more flexibility. Dataflows supports a wide range of cloud and on-premises sources.\n\nPrevent analysts from having direct access to the underlying data source. Since report creators can build on top of dataflows, it may be more convenient for you to allow access to underlying data sources only to a few individuals, and then provide access to the dataflows for analysts to build on top of. This approach reduces the load to the underlying systems and gives administrators finer control of when the systems get loaded from refreshes.\n\nOnce you've created a dataflow, you can use Power BI Desktop and the Power BI service to create datasets, reports, dashboards, and apps that use the Common Data Model to drive deep insights into your business activities. Dataflow refresh scheduling is managed directly from the workspace in which your dataflow was created, just like your datasets.\n\nTo create a dataflow, launch the Power BI service in a browser then select a workspace (dataflows are not available in my-workspace in the Power BI service) from the navigation pane on the left, as shown in the following screen. You can also create a new workspace in which to create your new dataflow.\n\nThe next two steps are to schedule a refresh and build the dataset using your Power BI desktop.\n\nFor more information or instructions on how to create a dataflow, see the following article.\n\nNeed help?

The following is a list of embedding scenarios you may elect to use. We will examine each option through the remainder this module.\n\nPublish to web\n\nEmbed in Microsoft Teams\n\nSharePoint Online web part\n\nEmbed in PowerApps\n\nThere is also a special version of Power BI that can be initiated through the Azure portal called Power BI Embedded (PBIE). PBIE allows application developers to embed fully interactive reports into their applications. Microsoft developed Power BI Embedded for independent software vendors (ISVs) wanting to embed visuals into their applications to help their customers make analytic decisions and spares ISVs from having to build their own analytics' solutions. \n\nFor more information about PBIE, see this article.\n\nPublish to web\n\nWith the Power BI Publish to web option, you can easily embed interactive Power BI content in blog posts, websites, emails, or social media. You can also easily edit, update, refresh, or stop sharing your published visuals.\n\n Note\n\nPublish to web is disabled by default. Power BI admins can enable this feature in the Admin portal > tenant settings > export and sharing settings.\n\n Warning\n\nProceed with caution. When you use Publish to web, anyone on the Internet can view your published report or visual. Viewing requires no authentication. These factors of Publish to web make it an excellent option for publishing public relations material. It includes viewing detail-level data that your reports aggregate. Before publishing a report, make sure it's okay for you to share the data and visualizations publicly. Don't publish confidential or proprietary information. If in doubt, check your organization's policies before publishing.\n\nAccess the publish to web option through the Power BI admin portal.\n\nFor more information on the publish to web option, see this article.\n\nEmbed in Microsoft Teams\n\nYou can embed Power BI reports in Microsoft Teams. In your Microsoft Teams channel, select the + sign and choose the Power BI option as a tab. Microsoft Teams automatically detects all the reports in your Power BI groups and in My Workspace. You can choose which reports you want to show in your Power BI tab in your channel.\n\nSharePoint Online web part\n\nWith the new Power BI report web part for SharePoint Online, you can easily embed interactive Power BI reports in SharePoint Online pages.\n\nWhen using the new Embed in SharePoint Online option, the embedded reports respect all item permissions and data security through row-level security (RLS), so you can easily create secure internal portals.\n\nEmbedding a report in SharePoint Online requires no coding knowledge, does not work with on-premises SharePoint and requires the user to log into SharePoint to access reports.\n\nFor more information regarding embedding reports in a SharePoint Online web part, see this article.\n\nEmbed in PowerApps\n\nTo embed dashboards and reports in PowerApps, the embed content in apps under developer settings on the portal must be enabled. In this setting, you will also select which users can embed content in apps. You have the option to enable the entire organization or restrict the capability to specific security groups.\n\nNext unit: REST API custom development\n\nContinue\n\nNeed help?

It is comparable to the unified Office 365 audit log in the sense that both logs contain a complete copy of the Power BI auditing data, but there are also several key differences that are important for Power BI service admins, as the following table reveals.\n\nTable with Unified Audit Log versus Power BI Activity Log. The unified audit log includes events from SharePoint Online, Exchange Online, Dynamics 365, and other services in addition to the Power BI auditing events. Only users with View-Only Audit Logs or Audit Logs permissions have access, such as global admins and auditors. Global admins and auditors can search the unified audit log by using Office 365 Security & Compliance Center, the Microsoft 365 Security Center, and the Microsoft 365 Compliance Center. Global admins and auditors can download audit log entries by using Office 365 Management APIs and cmdlets. By contrast, the Power BI activity log only includes the Power BI auditing events. Global admins and Power BI service admins have access. There's no user interface to search the activity log yet. Global admins and Power BI service admins can download activity log entries by using a Power BI REST API and management cmdlet.\n\nTo distinguish the Power BI-specific log from the unified audit log, Microsoft uses the name activity log for Power BI, but the Power BI auditing data within both logs is identical. In this way, global admins and auditors can continue to use the Security and Compliance Centers for all their auditing needs, while Power BI service admins now have a straightforward way to access and download the data they need to monitor the actions of their users and administrators in their Power BI tenant.\n\nFor more information regarding the new Power BI activity log cmdlet, see Introducing the Power BI Activity Log | Microsoft Power BI Blog | Microsoft Power BI blog post.\n\nNeed help?

With Power BI, you have two options to track user activity: The Power BI activity log and the unified audit log. The Power BI activity log will be covered in Unit 5 of this course.\n\nAs the tenant admin, it's likely that at some point you'll be required to answer questions about a specific instance or activity in the tenant. Questions such as who is accessing my report, or when did they access the report will require investigation by the tenant admin. These investigations can be done through the O365 cloud. But these queries produce event activity records on all products in the O365 container, including:\n\nSharePoint Online\nExchange Online\nDynamics 365\nOther services\nPower BI auditing events\n\nAccess to audit logs is restricted to Microsoft 365 global administrators and require an Exchange Online license. You can use a PowerShell cmdlet to download the data for investigations and analysis, but the data is only retained for 90 days. A good practice may be to log regularly scheduled queries in a repository that can be reserved for access beyond the 90-day period.\n\nThe following is an example of an audit log search.\n\nThe Power BI audit log search is primarily a manual task.

Some of the metrics identify who the users are and how frequently the users are accessing the dashboard or report.\n\nFollowing is an example of a dashboard usage metrics report.\n\nReported usage metrics may differ from audit log numbers because of the way in which different reporting systems collect the metrics.\n\n Note\n\nSeveral screenshot examples shown in this module include personally identifiable information (PII.) An important privacy feature is that Admins can hide user details from usage metrics via tenant settings. For additional information regarding hiding user details, see Exclude user information from usage metrics reports.\n\nUsage metrics reports are read-only. However, you can personalize a usage metrics report by using \"Save as.\" This creates a brand-new dataset and converts the read-only report to a full-featured Power BI report that can be edited. Not only does the personalized report contain metrics for the selected dashboard or report, removing the default filter allows access to usage metrics for all dashboards or all reports in the selected workspace. Using this practice also allows you to capture the names of your end users. Lastly, the admin settings that control who can access reports allow admins to reflect which users are shown by name. This may be important for compliance, as in some countries/regions such as Germany, restrict by law the ability to show who is doing what as part of their job. For these cases Power BI gives the admin a way to prevent showing a group of users by name.\n\nFor additional information about usage metrics for dashboards and reports, view this article.\n\nNeed help?
