This view provides a high-level record of what's going on in a tenant. Interestingly, it's sometimes more important to realize what's not happening in a tenant. For example, if a company has many Power BI Pro licenses that aren't used effectively, corrective action can then be taken. These reports tend not to be time bound, or time sensitive. They'll present what objects are being accessed by how many users. However, the report won't reflect the times during the day or reporting period when usage was highest.\n\nNew usage metrics are being regularly added to this report.\n\nFor additional information about Power BI usage metrics, review the Usage Metrics section of this article.\n\nNeed help?

As an administrator it's important to know what's going on in the Power BI environment.\n\nKey information required by an administrator includes things like, what solutions are being deployed, whether users have access to them, and knowing what users are doing when using the solutions in their BI environment.\n\nAnother element of data governance is control. This includes the enforcement of policies dictating acceptable use of the system by defining who in the organization has authority and control over data assets and how those data assets may be used.\n\nA third component of data governance is compliance. This means that processes are in place to control your data and ensure that all regulations are met in all your organization's data practices.

Each group has assigned tasks and responsibilities. The three groups are the IT/BI team, the business users, and central IT.\n\nThe IT/BI team is responsible for designing models and processes for collecting, cleaning, and cataloging data. The IT/BI team is also responsible for developing rules that determine what reports are created and how they're distributed to the organization.\n\nThe business users' primary responsibilities are to research and document the BI system requirements, including needs for ad hoc analysis and reporting, and how users of the system will work together towards shared or common goals.\n\nThe third group, central IT, contributes to the development of several components of a BI governance model. Starting with training and education, which teaches users, administrators, auditors, and governors of the system how to optimize the output of the environment. Another component is data governance, or the process of governing and managing data to ensure the accuracy, completeness, integrity, and timeliness of data. A third component in our model is the enablement of business process and access controls to define the approval processes for who should be granted access to the system, what they can do in the system, and when they should have access to it. The last component is procurement and administration, which supports the purchasing and procurement of the BI system elements.\n\nNeed help?

Your report will now appear in Power BI service. For more information, go to Publish datasets and reports from Power BI Desktop.\n\nBest practices\n\nCreating a report is meant to inform and drive action on the part of the report user. It isn't enough to create a report with sales information on it; the report author should always ask themselves several questions:\n\nWhat purpose is this report for?\n\nWho is using the report?\n\nHow can I help people do a better job?\n\nWhat is the most important information and how can I highlight it?\n\nIs this report readable?\n\nCan people change the elements that they need to if their questions change?\n\nDo I have visuals that are distracting from the core message of the report?\n\nIs this report staying focused in a single topic or only a few topics?\n\nAm I providing all information that the user expects to see in the report?\n\nCreating good headers and footers is an excellent way to help the user interpret the report. You can provide guidance to the user by documenting why this report was created. Adding a report implementation date and time is an excellent practice. Occasionally, reports are run and then saved. People who are looking at a report won't know that they're looking at an older version unless that fact is highlighted in a footer.\n\nTarget the report for your appropriate region. English speakers read top-down, left-to-right. Putting important information, like totals, at the top of the report will highlight that information for English speakers. The way people read dates varies across different countries/regions. For example, Europeans and Americans have different conventions for reading dates. Localize data formats to the appropriate target user.\n\nIn addition to focusing on the visual aspects of the report, a good report author will consider report delivery and data source usage. Good delivery focuses on how the user wants to see the report. Therefore, report authors should ask themselves the following questions to test the appropriate delivery format and ensure that the report is rendering correctly in that format:\n\nDoes the user want the report sent to them in an email message?\n\nDoes the user want the report in a printable format?\n\nDoes the user read the report in a web browser?\n\nPay attention to the height and width of the report page. Verify that the report isn't running off the page when the report renders for the user.\n\nA good report author creates reports that are easy on the data source. If you continue to recall data that you don't need from a data source, you will overburden the data source and affect performance in unpredictable ways. Focusing on only getting pertinent data will help you be a responsible teammate to others who are using the same data.\n\nNeed help?

Select the Insert tab from the ribbon at the top to see your options for adding a visual.\n\nFor the purposes of this example, a table visual has been added to the design surface.\n\nWhen you select the Table drop-down menu, you can choose from two options: Insert Table or Table Wizard. Select Insert Table. You can now draw a table on the design surface. From the Report data window, drag fields from the dataset to the table on the design surface.\n\nWhen you have finished, notice that the field is added to the lower portion of the table in the square brackets. The header will also be added. You can rename or apply formatting to the headers, such as bolding or underlining the text.\n\nTo test this simple report, select the Run button from the Home tab in the ribbon.\n\nThe report will run and display actual data in the table.\n\nNotice that some items have changed in the report: a title was entered at the top, table headers were renamed and are in bold font, and a background color was selected on the header. These changes were implemented to help make using the report easier for the report reader.\n\nIf you want to return to the design surface, select the Design button.\n\nAnother aspect of creating a report is to add a parameter. Parameters can be used for different reasons, for example, when you want the user to enter information that displays on a visual on the report. The most popular reason to add a parameter is to affect which data is retrieved from the data source.\n\nConsider the scenario where you are creating a report that retrieves data from a sales database. You only want sales data from between a begin date and an end date. In this case, you would create two parameters and then modify the dataset query to include those parameters in the WHERE clause of the query. Your first step in this situation is to add a parameter.\n\nAdd parameters\n\nTo add a parameter, right-click Parameters and select Add Parameter.\n\nOn the General tab, name the parameter, select the data type, and then choose the prompt that the user will see.\n\nOn the Available Values tab, enter options that the user can choose from. The Default Values tab has the initial value of the parameter when the report loads, but it can be changed by the user.\n\nYou can also get parameter values from a query. For more information, see the Microsoft documentation on parameters.\n\nAfter you have created a parameter, you can use it to interact with the report. If you return to the dataset, you can connect that parameter with the query.\n\nThe parameter reference starts with the at (@) symbol. Add the parameter name to the query text. Now, when the report refreshes, the data will be pulled from the data source according to the WHERE clause and the parameter value.\n\nNext unit: Work with charts on the report\n\nContinue\n\nNeed help?

Paginated reports are ideal for creating sales invoices, receipts, purchase orders, and tabular data. This module will teach you how to create reports, add parameters, and work with tables and charts in paginated reports.\n\nPaginated reports defined\n\nPaginated reports give a pixel-perfect view of the data. Pixel perfect means that you have total control of how the report renders. If you want a footer on every sales receipt that you create, a paginated report is the appropriate solution. If you want a certain customer's name to always appear in green font on a report, you can do that in a paginated report.\n\nPower BI paginated reports are descendants of SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS), which was first introduced in 2004. Power BI paginated reports and SSRS have a lot in common. If you're looking for information on paginated reports and can't find it, searching the internet and Microsoft documentation on SSRS is an excellent idea because you'll find numerous blog posts, videos, and documentation available to you.\n\nWhen paginated reports are the right fit\n\nYou can use paginated reports for operational reports with tables of details and optional headers and footers.\n\nAdditionally, you can use paginated reports when you expect to print the report on paper or when you want an e-receipt, a purchase order, or an invoice. Paginated reports also render tabular data exceedingly well. You can have customized sort orders, clickable-headers, and URLs in results, which allows for simple integration with custom applications.\n\nPower BI paginated reports can also display all of your data in a single report element, such as a table. If you have 25,000 records, and you want the reports to print over 100 pages, you can do that. If you want every third record to be printed with a light pink background, you can do that as well.\n\nPower BI paginated reports are not created in Power BI Desktop; they are built by using Power BI Report Builder. You can share paginated reports with either a Power BI Pro or a Power BI premium license.\n\nIn this module, you will:\n\nGet data.\n\nCreate a paginated report.\n\nWork with charts and tables on the report.\n\nPublish the report.\n\nNext unit: Get data\n\nContinue\n\nNeed help?

Though this process might seem similar to getting data in Power BI, it is different. Power BI paginated reports do not use Power Query when connecting to data sources.\n\nGetting data in a Power BI paginated report does not involve data cleaning steps. In fact, data is not stored in a Power BI paginated report dataset. When data is refreshed on the report, it is retrieved in an unaltered form from the data source, according to the query that was used to retrieve it.\n\nData can be collected from multiple data sources, including Microsoft Excel, Oracle, SQL Server, and many more. However, after the data has been collected, the different data sources cannot be merged into a single semantic model. Each source must be used for a different purpose. For instance, data from an Excel source can be used for a chart, while data from SQL Server can be used for a table on a single report. Paginated reports have an expression language that can be used to look up data in different datasets, but it is nothing like Power Query.\n\nPower BI paginated reports can use a dataset from Power BI service. These datasets have used Power Query to clean and alter the data. The difference is that this work was done in Power BI Desktop or SQL Server Data Tools prior to using Power BI Report Builder, which doesn't have that tool in the user interface.\n\nCreate and configure a data source\n\nTo retrieve data, open Power BI Report Builder. From the Getting Started screen, select New Report. You can choose whether to create a report with a table on it, a chart, or a blank report. For the purposes of this example, a blank report has been selected. These choices create a default visual on your new report, which can be changed at any time. Next, go to the Report Data window, which is typically on the left side of the tool, though it can be moved around.\n\nRight-click the Data Sources folder and select Add Data Source.\n\nOn the General tab, name the data source.\n\nAfter naming the data source, choose the correct connection string by selecting the Build button.\n\nAfter you have selected Build, the Connection Properties screen appears. The properties on this screen will be unique for each data source. The following figure is an example of what you might see in the screen. The figure shows the properties of a SQL Server connection that you, the report author, will enter:\n\nServer name\n\nDatabase name\n\nA button for testing the connection\n\nSelect OK to continue\n\nYou can also enter username and password information on the Connection Properties screen, or you can leave it on the default setting and use your Windows credentials. Select OK again.\n\nYou've now created a data source.\n\nGenerally, authentication is beyond the scope of this course. Typically, you will receive the connection information from your IT department, application specialist, or the software vendor.\n\nCreate and configure a dataset\n\nA data source is the connection information to a particular resource, like SQL Server. A dataset is the saved information of the query against the data source, not the data. The data always resides in its original location.\n\nRight-click Datasets in the Report View window and select Add Dataset. Ensure that the correct data source is selected. This action will run the query against the correct data source.\n\nFrom the window that displays, you can:\n\nName the query.\n\nChoose whether to use a text command or a stored procedure.\n\nEnter a query into the text box.\n\nNeed help?

For this reason, dashboards are ideal to support real-time monitoring scenarios.\n\nThere are four special types of Power BI datasets that support real-time dashboards. They are:\n\nStreaming dataset\nPush dataset\nHybrid dataset\nPubNub streaming dataset\n\nThere aren’t any requirements that real-time dashboards or their related datasets be stored in a dedicated capacity.\n\n Tip\n\nRemember that dashboards can refresh as frequently as every 15 minutes when its tiles connect to a regular dataset that represents a DirectQuery model. For more information, see Unit 3.\n\nDashboards offer an interesting capability that reports don’t. You can set dashboard tiles (that display a single numeric value) to alert you when data values reach specific thresholds. At Adventure Works, their manufacturing plant is set up with many IoT devices. A Power BI dashboard presents real-time manufacturing metrics and notifies maintenance staff when devices require attention.\n\nUse streaming datasets\n\nA streaming dataset specifically delivers real-time data with latency of about one second. Real-time dashboard tile updates are smooth and fluid.\n\nThe streaming dataset caches data in a temporary cache for up to 60 minutes. Because there’s no data model, it’s not possible to create Power BI reports that connect to a streaming dataset. Instead, to visualize streaming data, you add streaming tiles to the dashboard. A streaming tile specifically visualizes real-time data sources from a streaming dataset. They’re easy to identify in a dashboard because they’re adorned with a lightning strike icon.\n\nStreaming datasets are simple in their design because they represent a single table. Table columns are either text, number, or date. You can create a streaming dataset in the Power BI service or programmatically by using the Power BI REST API.\n\nDevelopers can programmatically insert rows into the dataset by sending a JSON document to the dataset’s endpoint. The endpoint URL includes an authentication key.\n\nHere’s a methodology to create a real-time dashboard by using a streaming dataset:\n\nCreate a streaming dataset.\n\nAdd a streaming tile to a dashboard.\n\nProgrammatically insert rows into the streaming dataset.\n\nHowever, there are some important limitations to bear in mind:\n\nData retention is 60 minutes, so it’s not possible to monitor on history beyond that time.\n\nThe maximum ingestion rate is 5 requests/second.\n\nThe packet size of a request to add new rows can’t exceed 15 KB.\n\nPower BI reports can’t connect to a streaming dataset.\n\nBecause dashboards don’t support filtering, you can’t filter streaming tiles.\n\nUse push datasets\n\nA push dataset specifically delivers real-time data with latency of between 3-5 seconds. While structurally it’s closely related to a Power BI import dataset, push datasets can’t be created by using Power BI Desktop. A push dataset can include multiple tables, relationships, and measures. However, it can’t include some model objects, like hierarchies and security roles.\n\nAs the dataset type name suggests, data is pushed into dataset tables. When data is pushed, Power BI immediately refreshes related dashboard tiles.\n\nYou can create a push dataset in the Power BI service (or as a hybrid dataset as described later) or programmatically by using the Power BI REST API. Developers must first acquire a Microsoft Entra access token to work with the REST API operations. They can use the API to push rows of data to a specific table. There are also API operations they can use to modify the dataset schema, delete all rows from a table, and delete the dataset.\n\nIt's also possible use Azure Stream Analytics (ASA) to create a push dataset and output rows of data to it. As a complex event-processing engine, ASA can push high volumes of fast streaming data, even from thousands of IoT devices. For more information, see Power BI output from Azure Stream Analytics.\n\n Tip\n\nASA can integrate with Azure Machine Learning (AML), allowing output of machine learning predictions. For example, an ASA job output could predict that an IoT device requires maintenance. You can set up a Power BI dashboard tile to alert you when maintenance is required. For more information, see Integrate Azure Stream Analytics with Azure Machine Learning.\n\nHere’s a methodology to create a real-time dashboard by using a push dataset:\n\nCreate a push dataset.\n\nCreate a Power BI report that connects to the push dataset. Use any type of visual, including custom visuals to visualize the dataset data.\n\nPin report visuals to a dashboard.\n\nOptionally, use the dashboard Q&A experience to add other tiles.\n\nProgrammatically push rows into the push dataset table.\n\nHowever, there are some important limitations to bear in mind:\n\nThe dataset can’t contain more than 75 tables, and tables can’t contain more than 75 columns.\n\nA push dataset table can’t store more than 5 million rows, unless the basicFIFO retention policy is enabled. When enabled, a table will store approximately 200,000 rows of data and Power BI will replace older rows with new rows.\n\nA single request can’t push more than 10,000 rows.\n\nThe ingestion rate is limited to one million rows per hour unless the table stores more than 250,000 rows of data. In this case, the ingestion rate is limited to 120 rows per hour.\n\nUse hybrid datasets\n\nA hybrid dataset is both a streaming and push dataset at the same time. It delivers the benefits of both types of datasets. Use a hybrid dataset to visualize real-time data in streaming tiles and regular tiles, which you pin from Power BI reports or Q&A. Also, hybrid datasets allow your real-time solution to monitor and analyze activities that happened more than 60 minutes ago.\n\nWhen you create a streaming dataset in the Power BI service, you can make it a hybrid dataset by enabling the Historic data analysis option.\n\nUse PubNub streaming datasets\n\nA PubNub streaming dataset is a special type of streaming dataset. It requires you to have an established real-time platform with PubNub. The Power BI web client uses the PubNub SDK to read an existing PubNub data stream. Like with streaming datasets, there’s no underlying data model, so it’s not possible to use Power BI report visuals.\n\nInstead, dashboard streaming tiles connect to a PubNub streaming dataset. These tiles are optimized to quickly display real-time data. Because Power BI connects directly to the PubNub data stream, there’s little latency between when the data is pushed and when the tiles update.\n\nCompare streaming and push datasets\n\nThe following table compares the capabilities of streaming and push datasets.\n\nExpand table\nCapability\tStreaming dataset\tPush dataset\nLatency\t~1 second\t3-5 seconds\nData retention\t60 minutes\t5 million rows per table, or 200,000 rows when basicFIFO retention is set\nMaximum ingestion rates\t5 requests/second, 15 KB per request\t1 request/second, 16 MB per request (maximum 10,000 rows)\nData throughput limits\tNone\t1 million rows/hour, but 120 rows/hours when the table exceeds 250,000 rows\nDataset structure\tSingle table\tRich data model that supports filtering and aggregation\nVisual types\tStreaming tiles only\tReport visuals, including custom visuals\nAnimation updates\tSmooth and fluid\tA bit twitchy\nNext unit: Set-up auto-refresh paginated reports\n\nContinue\n\nNeed help?

Artifacts include Power BI reports, dashboards, and paginated reports. Whether viewed in the Power BI service, a Power BI mobile app, or an app with embedded Power BI content, Power BI content will refresh automatically to always show current data. Depending on the real-time feature, Power BI can reliably show current data with just seconds of latency.\n\nHere’s an example of a real-time Power BI report. It relies upon a feature known as automatic page refresh, which is described in the next unit.\n\n Tip\n\nIn general, you should strive to deliver real-time Power BI visualizations with Power BI reports. They provide the greatest design flexibility, can be filtered, and are highly interactive. Considering creating real-time Power BI dashboards when you can’t achieve the requirements with Power BI reports, like when alerting is a requirement.\n\nYou should factor into your requirements what degree of latency is tolerable. It often depends on the velocity (or volatility) of the data, and the urgency to keep people informed about the current state of data.\n\nConsider at Adventure Works that there’s a daily finance report. Report consumers expect to see complete financial data up until the previous day. They might describe that requirement as real-time, especially if former reporting solutions took days or weeks to deliver yesterday’s data. From a Power BI perspective, that’s not real-time. A regular Power BI dataset, set up to refresh daily (or even every 30 minutes) could deliver that result.\n\nNow consider a different requirement at Adventure Works. This time, it’s a manufacturing dashboard that allows users to monitor the production processes as they’re happening. Users need to monitor the hundreds of IoT devices to learn about their throughput and anomalies, like excessive waits and delays. This dashboard can be considered real-time because it must show low-latency metrics and refresh the data constantly.\n\nTo be clear, Power BI real-time solutions are concerned with producing up-to-date results with between one second and 15 minutes of latency. Power BI can manage latencies greater than 15 minutes by using conventional data refresh techniques. Power BI isn’t well suited when latency delays can’t exceed one second.\n\nTo create real-time Power BI solutions, you might require advanced data modeling skills or programming skills.\n\nSet automatic dashboard tile refresh\n\n Note\n\nThe focus of this module is on using Power BI real-time features. However, it’s helpful to know that in some circumstances you can achieve real-time results without these features.\n\nPower BI datasets that represent a DirectQuery data model (or live connection to an external-hosted data model, like Azure Analysis Services or SQL Server Analysis Services)) provide an easy way to deliver real-time dashboards. In the dataset settings, you can enable the dataset Automatic dashboard tile refresh property. You can then set a refresh frequency between weekly and every 15 minutes.\n\nFor example, when you set the refresh frequency to 15 minutes, Power BI will refresh dashboard tile caches every 15 minutes. Dashboard consumers will see tiles (that connect to the dataset) update in real-time.\n\nWhile this technique is simple to set up, take care not to place too much burden on the DirectQuery data source(s), especially when datasets enforce dynamic row-level security (RLS). Dynamic RLS applies filters based on the current user.\n\nConsider that a dashboard with 10 tiles, shared with 100 users, connects to a DirectQuery dataset that enforces dynamic RLS, and it’s set to refresh tiles every 15 minutes. It will result in Power BI sending at least 1000 tile refresh queries to the data source every 15 minutes.\n\nNext unit: Set up automatic page refresh\n\nContinue\n\nNeed help?

It’s a setting you can enable for a specific report page providing the report connects to a dataset that:\n\nIncludes DirectQuery storage tables.\nIs a live connection to a tabular model in Azure Analysis Services (AAS) or SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS).\nIs a push (or hybrid) dataset.\n\n Note\n\nPush and hybrid datasets are described in the next unit.\n\nConceptually, the APR feature is simple. According to a refresh interval you set, Power BI automatically refreshes the report page. It simulates the same refresh operation that the report consumer can invoke from the action bar.\n\nWork with DirectQuery storage tables\n\nA Power BI dataset can have DirectQuery storage tables when:\n\nIt represents a DirectQuery model.\nIt represents a composite model.\nIt contains a hybrid table.\nIt consumes a streaming dataflow (and uses DirectQuery storage mode).\n\n Note\n\nFor more information about DirectQuery and composite models, work through the Choose a model framework module.\n\nUse hybrid tables\n\nIf you set up a dataset import table by using the Power BI incremental refresh feature, you can enable the Get the latest data in real-time with DirectQuery option.\n\nBy enabling this option, Power BI automatically creates a table partition that uses DirectQuery storage mode. In this case, the table becomes a hybrid table, meaning it has import partitions to store older data, and a single DirectQuery partition for current data.\n\nWhen Power BI queries a hybrid table, the query may use the cache for older data, or passthrough to the data source to retrieve current data.\n\nThis option is only available with a Premium license.\n\nFor more information, see Configure incremental refresh and real-time data.\n\nUse streaming dataflows\n\nA streaming dataflow allows data modelers to connect to, ingest, mash up, model, and build reports based on streaming, near real-time data directly in the Power BI service.\n\n Note\n\nA streaming dataflow is conceptually different from a regular dataflow.\n\nYou create streaming dataflows in the Power BI service. They ingest streaming input that you can source from Azure Event Hubs, Azure IoT Hubs, or Azure Blob storage. Using a drag-and-drop, no-code designer, you can filter, aggregate, join, group, and union input streams. You can also set up time-window functions, which can use tumbling, hopping, sliding, session, or snapshot windows of time.\n\nStreaming dataflows are consumed by a model that you develop in Power BI Desktop. Use the dataflows connector to connect to the streaming dataflow, and be sure to set the model storage mode to DirectQuery.\n\nFor more information, see Streaming dataflows.\n\nThere are some important restrictions to bear in mind:\n\nStreaming dataflows are only available with a Premium license.\nA Power BI administrator must enable streaming dataflows.\nA capacity administrator must enable the dataflows enhanced compute engine.\nYou can’t store streaming dataflows and regular dataflows in the same workspace.\nSet up automatic page fresh\n\nTo set up APR, in the page settings, you enable the Page refresh setting.\n\n Note\n\nThis setting is only available when the report connects to a supported dataset. It won’t be available, for example, when the report connects to a dataset that represents in import model.\n\nOnce enabled, you can set the Refresh type property to one of two options:\n\nAuto page refresh – Updates all page visuals based on a fixed interval, which can be from every one second to multiple days.\nChange detection – Updates all page visuals providing that source data has changed since the last automatic refresh. It avoids unnecessary refreshes, which can help to reduce resource consumption for the Power BI service and the data source. This option is only supported for reports stored in a workspace that has its license mode set to Premium, Premium per user, or Embedded (known as Premium workspaces).\n\n Important\n\nWhen using a fixed interval, consider the burden it might place on the data source. Factor in that multiple users may open the report page, and that each visual on the page results in at least one query to the data source.\n\nSet up change detection\n\nTo set up change detection, you must create a special type of measure called a change detection measure. Your report can only have one change detection measure. Power BI uses it to query the data source. Each time, Power BI stores the query result so it can compare it with the next result (according to the refresh interval you set). When the results differ, Power BI refreshes the page.\n\nChange detection measures are easy to set up in Power BI Desktop. The Change detection window allows defining a change detection measure that summarizes any column by using an aggregate function (count, count distinct, minimum, maximum, and sum).\n\nAt Adventure Works, they use APR to monitor real-time manufacturing metrics. IoT devices store events that include a timestamp. The change detection measure queries for the maximum timestamp event because the page should only refresh when new events are recorded.\n\nIn Power BI Desktop, you can use Performance Analyzer to monitor when Power BI queries the change detection measure, and when visuals refresh. For more information, see Use Performance Analyzer to examine report element performance.\n\nWork with restrictions\n\nOnce you publish an APR report to the Power BI service, Power BI may enforce restrictions related to APR.\n\nWhen you publish a report to a workspace that has its license mode set to Pro, it means the workspace resides in a shared capacity. A shared capacity is shared with other Microsoft customers. To avoid noisy neighbor situations (where a co-tenant monopolizes resources), an APR refresh has a minimum interval of 30 minutes, even if the refresh interval in your report is less than that value. Change detection measures aren’t supported in shared capacities.\n\nWhen you publish a report to a workspace that has its license mode set to Premium per user, or Embedded (called a dedicated capacity), APR may not be enabled or is constrained. That’s because a capacity admin can enable or disable APR, and enable or disable the use of a change detection measure for a dedicated capacity. They can also set a minimum refresh interval and a minimum execution interval for change detection measures. When your report page settings are lower than the minimum intervals, the minimum intervals will prevail.\n\nFor more information about APR support for different datasets and capacity types, see Restrictions on refresh intervals.\n\nNext unit: Create real-time dashboards\n\nContinue\n\nNeed help?
