You can create a Synapse Analytics workspace in an Azure subscription interactively by using the Azure portal, or you can automate deployment by using Azure PowerShell, the Azure command-line interface (CLI), or with an Azure Resource Manager or Bicep template.\n\nAfter creating a Synapse Analytics workspace, you can manage the services in it and perform data analytics tasks with them by using Synapse Studio; a web-based portal for Azure Synapse Analytics.\n\nWorking with files in a data lake\n\nOne of the core resources in a Synapse Analytics workspace is a data lake, in which data files can be stored and processed at scale. A workspace typically has a default data lake, which is implemented as a linked service to an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 container. You can add linked services for multiple data lakes that are based on different storage platforms as required.\n\nIngesting and transforming data with pipelines\n\nIn most enterprise data analytics solutions, data is extracted from multiple operational sources and transferred to a central data lake or data warehouse for analysis. Azure Synapse Analytics includes built-in support for creating, running, and managing pipelines that orchestrate the activities necessary to retrieve data from a range of sources, transform the data as required, and load the resulting transformed data into an analytical store.\n\n Note\n\nPipelines in Azure Synapse Analytics are based on the same underlying technology as Azure Data Factory. If you are already familiar with Azure Data Factory, you can leverage your existing skills to build data ingestion and transformation solutions in Azure Synapse Analytics.\n\nQuerying and manipulating data with SQL\n\nStructured Query Language (SQL) is a ubiquitous language for querying and manipulating data, and is the foundation for relational databases, including the popular Microsoft SQL Server database platform. Azure Synapse Analytics supports SQL-based data querying and manipulation through two kinds of SQL pool that are based on the SQL Server relational database engine:\n\nA built-in serverless pool that is optimized for using relational SQL semantics to query file-based data in a data lake.\nCustom dedicated SQL pools that host relational data warehouses.\n\nThe Azure Synapse SQL system uses a distributed query processing model to parallelize SQL operations, resulting in a highly scalable solution for relational data processing. You can use the built-in serverless pool for cost-effective analysis and processing of file data in the data lake, and use dedicated SQL pools to create relational data warehouses for enterprise data modeling and reporting.\n\nProcessing and analyzing data with Apache Spark\n\nApache Spark is an open source platform for big data analytics. Spark performs distributed processing of files in a data lake by running jobs that can be implemented using any of a range of supported programming languages. Languages supported in Spark include Python, Scala, Java, SQL, and C#.\n\nIn Azure Synapse Analytics, you can create one or more Spark pools and use interactive notebooks to combine code and notes as you build solutions for data analytics, machine learning, and data visualization.\n\nExploring data with Data Explorer\n\nAzure Synapse Data Explorer is a data processing engine in Azure Synapse Analytics that is based on the Azure Data Explorer service. Data Explorer uses an intuitive query syntax named Kusto Query Language (KQL) to enable high performance, low-latency analysis of batch and streaming data.\n\nIntegrating with other Azure data services\n\nAzure Synapse Analytics can be integrated with other Azure data services for end-to-end analytics solutions. Integrated solutions include:\n\nAzure Synapse Link enables near-realtime synchronization between operational data in Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Database, SQL Server, and Microsoft Power Platform Dataverse and analytical data storage that can be queried in Azure Synapse Analytics.\nMicrosoft Power BI integration enables data analysts to integrate a Power BI workspace into a Synapse workspace, and perform interactive data visualization in Azure Synapse Studio.\nMicrosoft Purview integration enables organizations to catalog data assets in Azure Synapse Analytics, and makes it easier for data engineers to find data assets and track data lineage when implementing data pipelines that ingest data into Azure Synapse Analytics.\nAzure Machine Learning integration enables data analysts and data scientists to integrate predictive model training and consumption into analytical solutions.\nNext unit: When to use Azure Synapse Analytics\n\nContinue\n\nHaving an issue?

For a data analyst, finding and understanding the data assets associated with a Synapse Analytics workspace can present a significant challenge before any analysis or reporting can even begin.\n\nMicrosoft Purview can help in this scenario by cataloging the data assets in a data map, and enabling data stewards to add metadata, categorization, subject matter contact details, and other information that helps data analysts identify and understand data.\n\nConfigure data access for Microsoft Purview\n\nIn order to scan the data assets in the data lake storage and databases used in your Azure Synapse Workspace, Microsoft Purview must have appropriate permissions to read the data. In practice, this means that the account used by your Microsoft Purview account (usually a system-assigned managed identity that is created when Microsoft Purview is provisioned) needs to be a member of the appropriate role-based access control (RBAC) and database roles.\n\nThe diagram shows that Microsoft Purview requires role membership that permits the following access:\n\nRead access to the Azure Synapse workspace (achieved through membership of the Reader role for the Azure Synapse Workspace resource in the Azure subscription).\nRead access to each SQL database that will be scanned (achieved through membership of the db_datareader fixed database role in each database).\nRead access to data lake storage (achieved through membership of the Storage Blob Data Reader role for the Azure Storage account hosting the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 container for the data lake).\n\n Tip\n\nLearn more:\n\nFor more information about RBAC in Microsoft Azure, see What is Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)?\nFor more information about database-level roles in Azure Synapse Analytics SQL pools, see Database-level roles.\n\nYou'll get a chance to assign RBAC and SQL database role membership to support Microsoft Purview data access for yourself in the exercise later in this module.\n\nRegister and scan data sources\n\nMicrosoft Purview supports the creation of a data map that catalogs data assets in collections by scanning registered sources. Collections form a hierarchy of logical groupings of related data assets, under a root collection that is created when you provision a Microsoft Purview account. You can use the Microsoft Purview Governance Portal to create and manage collections in your account.\n\nTo include assets from a particular data source, you need to register the source in a collection. Microsoft Purview supports many kinds of source, including:\n\nAzure Synapse Analytics - One or more SQL databases in a Synapse Analytics workspace.\nAzure Data Lake Storage Gen2 - Blob containers used to host folders and files in a data lake.\n\nTo catalog assets used in an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace, you can register one or both of these sources in a collection, as shown here:\n\nAfter registering the sources where your data assets are stored, you can scan each source to catalog the assets it contains. You can scan each source interactively, and you can schedule period scans to keep the data map up to date.\n\n Tip\n\nTo learn more about registering and scanning sources, see Scans and ingestion in Microsoft Purview.\n\nYou'll get a chance to register and scan sources for an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace in the exercise later in this module.\n\nView and manage cataloged data assets\n\nAs each scan finds data assets in the registered sources, they're added to the associated collection in the data catalog. You can query the data catalog in the Microsoft Purview Governance Portal to view and filter the data assets, as shown here:\n\nData assets include items in the registered data stores at multiple levels. For example, assets from an Azure Synapse Analytics source include databases, schemas, tables, and individual fields; and assets from an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 source include containers, folders, and files.\n\nYou can view and edit the properties of each asset to add contextual information such as descriptions, contacts for expert help, and other useful metadata. Data assets can also be classified using built-in or custom classifications that match specific patterns of data field to common types of data - for example, passport numbers, credit card numbers, and others.\n\n Tip\n\nTo learn more about data asset classification, see Data classification in the Microsoft Purview governance portal.\n\nNext unit: Connect Microsoft Purview to an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace\n\nContinue\n\nNeed help?

The results of metadata scanning are displayed on the schema tab of the asset.\n\n Note\n\nMetadata scanning must be enabled in the Power BI admin portal. See Set up metadata scanning in your organization to learn more.\n\nAfter performing a search in the Purview Governance Portal, select a Power BI asset from your search result to see the sensitivity labels and endorsement metadata. Additional business metadata includes the dataset user configuration, create datetime, and description.\n\nUnder the Schema tab, you can see the list of all the tables, columns, and measures created inside the Power BI dataset.\n\nFor more detail, selecting a particular field within the schema tab will take you to the details for that field. You can then view the overview, properties, lineage, contacts, and related assets for that particular field.\n\nMetadata scanning requires no special license. It works for all of your tenant metadata, including items that are located in non-Premium workspaces.\n\nIf you'd like more information about assets, you also have the option open the Power BI dataset in the Power BI service for further analytics, root-cause investigation, impact analysis, management tasks, and dataset enrichment.\n\nExtend your search with lineage\n\nIf you're using the search and browse features in Microsoft Purview to find assets for reporting or to troubleshoot existing assets, you likely need more information on where data actually comes from, and what transformation steps it has undergone. The lineage view displays the flow of data from the source through to Power BI assets, including dataflows, datasets, reports, and dashboards.\n\nAlthough you can track data lineage in Power BI, this information is limited to the items in a single workspace. Lineage in Purview enables you to view the movement of data across more than one workspace, in a single view.\n\nLineage enables easy troubleshooting and deeper analysis of analytics projects. You're able to look both up and down-stream, to perform either root cause or impact analysis.\n\nFor example, you can detect the Azure Synapse Analytics pipeline that is responsible for the transformation of the data upstream of Power BI.\n\nIn the Purview Governance Portal, lineage is displayed from the asset you're currently viewing.\n\nNeed help?

Each of them have a different meaning in the context of the data catalog.\n\nWhat is data classification?\n\nClassifications are annotations that can be assigned to entities. The flexibility of classifications enables you to use them for multiple scenarios such as:\n\nunderstanding the nature of data stored in the data assets\ndefining access control policies\n\nClassification is based on the business context of the data. For example, you might classify assets by Passport Number, Driver's License Number, Credit Card Number, SWIFT Code, Person’s Name, and so on. Microsoft Purview has more than 200 system classifiers today. Users can also define their own classifiers in the data catalog. As part of the scanning process, classifications are automatically detected and applied as metadata within the Purview Data Catalog.\n\nClassification rules\n\nIn Microsoft Purview, you can apply system or custom classifications on a file, table, or column asset. Microsoft Purview makes use of Regex patterns and bloom filters to classify data. These classifications are then associated with the metadata discovered in the Azure Purview Data Catalog.\n\nMetadata is used to help describe the data that is being scanned and made available in the catalog. During the configuration of a scan set, you can specify classification rules to apply during the scan that will also serve as metadata. The existing classification rules fall under five major categories:\n\nGovernment - covers attributes such as government identity cards, driver license numbers, passport numbers, etc.\nFinancial - covers attributes such as bank account numbers or credit card numbers.\nPersonal - personal information such as a person's age, date of birth, email address, phone number, etc.\nSecurity - attributes like passwords that may be stored.\nMiscellaneous - attributes not covered in the other categories.\nWhy classify data?\n\nA good data governance strategy includes a process to classify data to understand its level of confidentiality, determine if the data source is compliant with various regulations, or how long to retain it for. Classification in Microsoft Purview makes data assets easier to understand, search, and govern. Classification can also help you implement measures to protect sensitive data.\n\nOnce a classification is tagged to a data source after a scan, you can generate reports and insights to gain a stronger understanding of your data estate. Because classification is based on the business context of the data, it can help bridge the gap between the business and the data team.\n\nData classification: system vs. custom classification\n\nMicrosoft Purview supports both system and custom classifications. There are over +200 system classifications available in Microsoft Purview today. Data teams need to know that if necessary classifications aren't available out of the box, they can work with the data stewards to create custom classifications, to meet their own organizational data governance requirements.\n\n Important\n\nFor the entire list of available system classifications, see Supported classifications in Microsoft Purview.\n\nWho creates custom classifications?\n\nPurview Data Curators can create, update, and delete custom classifiers and classification rules. Purview Data Readers can only view classifiers and classification rules.\n\nIn practical terms, Data Curators may not be members of the data team. It is however critical that data team members understand classification to be able to successfully work together and govern data across an organization.\n\nWhat are data labels?\n\nThe Microsoft Purview Data Map supports labeling structured and unstructured data stored across various data sources. This may sound familiar to you from other Microsoft technologies - and may be known as sensitivity labels. The data map extends the use of sensitivity labels from Microsoft Purview Information Protection to assets stored in infrastructure cloud locations and structured data sources.\n\nLabels are defined in Microsoft Purview Information Protection, and you can extend the application to Microsoft Purview Data Catalog.\n\nThe screenshot below shows both data classification and label in the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog. You can see that this Azure SQL table has a column called “CreditCard”:\n\nClassified as “Credit Card Number” because scan detected numbers corresponding to credit card pattern rules.\nLabeled as “Confidential – Finance” because credit card number was defined in your organization as confidential information (and this label brings encryption).\n\nNeed help?

In Microsoft Purview Data Catalog, collections are key concept because they drive permissions and asset protection. Collections are also used to understand data estate health and catalog usage and adoption, as featured in the data stewardship section of your Data Estate Insights.\n\nCollections\n\nThe data map is at the core of Microsoft Purview, which keeps an up-to-date map of assets and their metadata across your data estate. To hydrate the data map, you need to register and scan your data sources, which is done at the collection level. Collections support organizational mapping of metadata. By using collections, you can manage and maintain data sources, scans, and assets in a hierarchy instead of a flat structure. Collections allow you to build a custom hierarchical model of your data landscape based on how your organization plans to use Microsoft Purview to govern your landscape.\n\nCollections also provide a security boundary for your metadata in the data map. Access to collections, data sources, and metadata is set up and maintained based on the collection’s hierarchy in Microsoft Purview, following a least-privilege model:\n\nUsers have the minimum amount of access they need to do their jobs.\nUsers don't have access to sensitive data that they don't need.\n\nData sources are registered at the collection level. Scan results can then be sent to this collection or a sub collection. The image below displays the structure of a collection.\n\n Tip\n\nLearn more about Microsoft Purview collections architectures and best practices.\n\nRegister and scan data sources\n\nData governance use begins at collection level, with the registration of data sources in Microsoft Purview governance portal. Microsoft Purview supports an array of data sources. Data teams (analysts, engineers, and scientists) may not be actively registering and scanning data in Microsoft Purview, but it's critical that data consumers understand governance efforts. Registering and scanning assets requires Data Curator permissions.\n\n Important\n\nData registered and scanned in Microsoft Purview only collects metadata information. Data remains in its location and isn't migrated to any other platform.\n\nRegister a data source\n\nRegistering a data source is done from within the Azure portal. Once you have a Microsoft Purview service configured in Azure, you use the Microsoft Purview governance portal to register your data sources.\n\nTo register a data source, you'll select the icon to register a data source as displayed in the image below. Selecting this icon will give you access to all data source connectors.\n\nBelow is a small sample of available connectors in Microsoft Purview Data Catalog. See supported data sources and file types for an up-to-date list of supported data sources and connectors.\n\nRegistering a data source is straightforward, you need to complete the required fields. Authentication will be done during the scanning phase.\n\nEach type of data source you choose will require specific information to complete the registration. For example, if your data sources reside in your Azure subscription, you'll choose the necessary subscription and storage account name.\n\nScan a data source\n\nOnce you have data sources registered in the Microsoft Purview governance portal and displayed in the data map, you can set up scanning. The scanning process can be triggered to run immediately or can be scheduled to run on a periodic basis to keep your Microsoft Purview account up to date.\n\nScanning assets is as simple as selecting New scan from the resource as displayed in the data map.\n\nYou'll now need to configure your scan and assign the following details:\n\nAssign a friendly name.\nDefine which integration runtime to use to perform the scan.\nCreate credentials to authenticate to your registered data sources.\nChoose a collection to send scan results.\n\nAfter the basic configuration, you'll scope your scan, which allows you to choose just a specific zone of your data source. For instance, if you have a collection called “Raw” in your data map, you can define the scope to scan only the raw container of your data lake.\n\nAfter configuring and scoping your scan, you'll define the scan rule set. A scan rule set is a container for grouping a set of scan rules together so that you can easily associate them with a scan. For example, you might create a default scan rule set for each of your data source types, and then use these scan rule sets by default for all scans within your company. You might also want users with the right permissions to create other scan rule sets with different configurations based on business need.\n\nOnce a scan is complete, you can refer to the scan details to view information about the number of scans completed, assets detected, assets classified, Scan information. It’s a good place to monitor scan progress, including success or failure.\n\n Tip\n\nRefer to Scanning best practices for more information on scanning assets.\n\nRoles and permissions\n\nPermissions in Microsoft Purview are assigned at collection level. Collections are used to organize assets and sources and can be thought of as a logical grouping of data assets.\n\nData teams looking to discover and use data need to be assigned the Data Reader role in a collection in Microsoft Purview. The Data Reader role enables users to find assets, but doesn't enable users to edit anything. The Data Curator role is required to edit information about assets, assign classifications, and associate assets with glossary entries. To set up scans via the Microsoft Purview Governance Portal, individuals need to be either a data curator on the collection or data curator and data source administrator where the source is registered.\n\nWhen a Microsoft Purview account is created, it starts with a root collection that has the same name as the Microsoft Purview account itself. The creator of the Microsoft Purview account is automatically added as a Collection Admin, who can then assign Data Source Admin, Data Curator, and Data Reader on this root collection, and can edit and manage this collection.\n\n Tip\n\nLearn more about Microsoft Purview permissions and access.\n\nNext unit: Classify and label data\n\nContinue\n\nNeed help?

If Azure Synapse Studio is massively deployed in your organization, you can get the data catalog experience directly in Azure Synapse Studio.\n\nThis integrated experience allows you to discover Microsoft Purview assets, interact with them through Synapse capabilities, and push lineage information to Microsoft Purview.\n\n Note\n\nTo connect an Microsoft Purview Account to a Synapse workspace, you need 2 types of permissions. You need a contributor role in Synapse workspace from Azure portal identity and access management (IAM). You also need access to that Microsoft Purview Account. For more information, see Microsoft Purview permissions.\n\nLet’s imagine you need to find and understand some assets before working with them in pipelines or notebooks. From Azure Synapse Studio, you can easily query your Microsoft Purview data catalog.\n\nIn Azure Synapse Studio, from the Data blade on the left, select Purview in the dropdown next to the search bar.\n\nSearch for the asset that exists in Purview. Imagine you're looking for movie files. Enter the keyword movie in the search bar, and fine tune your search by selecting Files as the object type and Raw as the collection.\n\nSelect the first asset “Movies.csv” to get asset details. Because you are in Azure Synapse Studio, you can also leverage Azure Synapse capabilities.\n\nFor instance, you can use Azure Synapse serverless to query your assets. Select Develop, New SQL Script and Select top 100.\n\nDouble check you're connected to your serveless instance and select Run to execute the script and get an overview of your data.\n\nAfter reviewing data, you can use the asset, for example, adding to a new dataflow in Azure Synapse.\n\n Note\n\nSee Connect an Microsoft Purview Account for detailed information about integrating Microsoft Purview into Azure Synapse Analytics.\n\nNext unit: Knowledge check\n\nContinue\n\nNeed help?

The Microsoft Purview data catalog offers a browse experience that enables exploration of available data, either by collection or by exploring the hierarchy of each data source in the catalog.\n\nBrowse by collection or source type\n\nIf you're new to an organization or department, you may want to familiarize yourself with the contents of the data estate. From the Microsoft Purview Studio home page, select the “Browse assets” tile to browse either by collection or by source type.\n\nHere you can specify whether you'd like to browse by collection or by source type.\n\nBrowse by collection allows you to explore the different collections you're a data reader or curator for. You'll only see collections you have access to. Select a collection to get a list of assets in that collection with the facets and filters available in search.\n\n Tip\n\nCollections are a tool to manage ownership and access control across assets and data sources. They also organize assets and sources into categories that are customized to match the business flow. See Create and manage collections in Microsoft Purview to learn more.\n\nBrowse by source type allows you to explore the hierarchies of data sources using an explorer view.\n\nAfter selecting a tile associated with a data source type, you'll see a list of assets belonging to that type. From there, you'll be able to use the explorer view to see parent and child assets.\n\nThe Microsoft Purview data catalog browse experience enables analysts or data consumers to explore what data is available in many different ways.
