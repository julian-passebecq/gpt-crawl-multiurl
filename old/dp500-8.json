This central place, Microsoft Purview data catalog, provides advanced search capabilities to quickly find the right assets and information. Using keywords, business terms and Microsoft Purview data catalog functionalities, you can find the assets needed to build and design reports.\n\nAs a data analyst looking for assets, you'll be searching the Microsoft Purview data catalog. This assumes that the Microsoft Purview data Map has been created by your organization. The data map provides the foundation for data discovery. The data map captures metadata about enterprise data in analytics and operations systems on-premises and in the cloud and must be established before the data catalog can be searched.\n\n Note\n\nLearn more about the Microsoft Purview data map components.\n\nSearch the Microsoft Purview data catalog\n\nFrom the Microsoft Purview Studio home page, users can type relevant keywords to start discovering assets. In this scenario, you're looking for “product sales.”\n\nThe screenshot below displays the search result, with all assets corresponding to the keywords entered in the search engine.\n\nYou can fine-tune your search using the filters on the left side of the page.\n\nYou can filter by:\n\nSource type (and instance if needed)\nObject type\nClassification\nGlossary term\nIf needed, more options are available like Collection, Contact and Label\n\nYou've been instructed to connect to sources like Azure SQL tables. In the result displayed below, two assets are displayed. To use the correct asset, it’s possible to browse each asset to dig for more detailed information. Alternatively, you can rely on the work done by the data stewards who have labeled certified assets for the organization.\n\nBefore using this asset to create your report, you need to verify more details and validate where data comes from to populate this asset. Select the asset to access more information.\n\nUnderstand a single asset\nAsset overview\n\nSelect an asset to see the overview. The overview displays information at a glance, including a description, asset classification, schema classification, collection path, asset hierarchy, and glossary terms.\n\nThe asset description provides a brief explanation of the purpose of an asset. Data stewards have made data analysts lives easier in the screenshot below, by noting that this is the correct resource to use for sales reporting.\n\nBeneath the description, you'll see the asset classification and schema classification.\n\nData classification, in the context of Microsoft Purview, is a way of categorizing data assets by assigning unique logical labels or classes. Classification is based on the business context of the data. For example, you might classify assets by Passport Number, Driver's License Number, Credit Card Number, SWIFT Code, Person’s Name, and so on. Asset classifications can be automatically applied during a scan or applied manually.\n\n Note\n\nMicrosoft Purview comes with more than 200 classifications out of the box. For a full list of classifications, see System classifications in Microsoft Purview.\n\nThe overview tab reflects both asset level classifications and column level classifications that have been applied, which you can also view as part of the schema.\n\n Important\n\nYou may notice that the classifications displayed above are sensitive or contain personally identifiable information (PII). data encryption is done at the source level, and Microsoft Purview stores only the metadata. It does not preview data.\n\nYou can also view the collection path, hierarchy and glossary terms on the right side of the overview tab.\n\nThe collection path refers to the location of the asset inside Microsoft Purview. You have the option to move an asset to another collection.\n\nYou can view the full asset hierarchy within the overview tab. As an example: if you navigate to a SQL table, then you can see the schema, database, and the server the table belongs to.\n\nGlossary terms are a managed vocabulary for business terms that can be used to categorize and relate assets across your environment. For example, terms like 'customer,' 'buyer, 'cost center,' or any terms that give your data context for your users. You can view the glossary terms for an asset in the overview section, and you can add a glossary term on an asset by editing the asset.\n\n Note\n\nFor more information, see the business glossary page.\n\nAsset schema\n\nThe schema view of the asset includes more granular details about the asset, such as column names, data types, column level classifications, terms, and descriptions.\n\nAsset lineage\n\nAsset lineage gives you a clear view of how the asset is populated and where data comes from. Data lineage is broadly understood as the lifecycle that spans the data's origin, and where it moves over time across the data estate. Data lineage is important to analysts because it enables understanding of where data is coming from, what upstream changes may have occurred, and how it flows through the enterprise data systems.\n\nA single view on the asset lineage tab displays the data flow to and from the asset. Asset lineage can also help you understand how the asset was built and how the asset is used inside the organization.\n\nThe columns pane on the left side of the lineage tab allows users to select and track columns as they flow through the lineage. For example, if you select the column Full Name, you can see how the Full Name field was created and where the information comes from.\n\n Note\n\nThe lineage view is a powerful way to understand the transformation process an asset has undergone. Learn more about the lineage experience in Microsoft Purview data catalog\n\nAsset contacts and related assets\n\nAsset contacts provide you contact details of experts or dataset owners with any questions. As a new analyst searching for the right data sources for your report, you may find these individuals helpful.\n\nIf needed, you can also navigate through the technical hierarchy of assets that are related to the current asset you're viewing.\n\nThe ability to search the Microsoft Purview data catalog has the potential to break down data silos and enable the next level of enterprise analytics.\n\nNext unit: Browse assets\n\nContinue\n\nNeed help?

The criteria that indicate whether Microsoft Purview will meet your requirements are:\n\nDiscovery\nGovernance\n\nLet's take a look at these criteria and see how Microsoft Purview can help address their needs.\n\nDiscovery\n\nWithout a central location to register data sources, you might be unaware of a data source unless you come into contact with it as part of another process.\n\nUnless you know the location of a data source, you can't connect to the data by using a client application. You're required to know the connection string or path.\n\nThe intended use of the data is hidden to you unless you know the location of a data source's documentation. Data sources and documentation might live in several places and be utilized through different kinds of experiences.\n\nGovernance\n\nAs the data in your organization grows, the task of discovering, protecting, and governing that data becomes more difficult. Data is stored in different locations, which might be required for compliance reasons. The data might contain sensitive information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, or other personal information.\n\nCompliance with company security policies, government regulations, and customer needs are critical considerations for data governance. Understanding which data sources contain sensitive information is key to knowing where protections are needed and how to guard against access to this sensitive data.\n\nApply the criteria\n\nLet's take a look at how Microsoft Purview can address the data discovery and governance criteria.\n\nDoes Microsoft Purview help with data discovery?\n\nDo you require a solution or centralized location to register data sources? Often, users might be unaware of a data source unless they come into contact with it as part of another process. Microsoft Purview can help provide a solution.\n\nAfter you've registered data sources in the Microsoft Purview governance portal and displayed them in the data map, you can set up scanning of those data sources. The metadata that's returned catalogs the data in those sources. In this way, it's easier for users to discover what the data sources contain. The metadata is indexed to make each data source easy to discover via search. It's also more understandable to the users who discover it.\n\nUsers can contribute to the catalog by tagging, documenting, and annotating data sources that have already been registered. They can register new data sources so that other catalog users can discover, understand, and utilize them.\n\nDoes Microsoft Purview help with data governance?\n\nMicrosoft Purview can scan and automatically classify data in files and tables. Microsoft Purview classifies data by Bloom Filter and RegEx. Bloom Filter classifications include attributes for city, country/region, place, and person information. RegEx classifications cover attributes that include categories like bank information (ABA routing numbers or country/region-specific banking account numbers), passport numbers, and country/region-specific identification numbers. You can find the full list of supported classifications in the documentation for Microsoft Purview.\n\nMicrosoft Purview also uses predefined Data Plane roles to help control who has access to the information in Microsoft Purview. For access, users can use the Microsoft Purview governance portal only if they're placed in at least one of the three supported roles. When a Microsoft Purview account is created, no one but the creator can access the account or use its APIs. New users must be put in one or more of the following roles:\n\nPurview Data Reader role: Has access to the Microsoft Purview governance portal and can read all content in Microsoft Purview except for scan bindings.\nPurview Data Curator role: Has access to the Microsoft Purview governance portal and can read all content in Microsoft Purview except for scan bindings. Can edit information about assets, classification definitions, and glossary terms. Can also apply classifications and glossary terms to assets.\nPurview Data Source Administrator role: Doesn't have access to the Microsoft Purview governance portal (unless the user is also in the Data Reader or Data Curator roles). Can manage all aspects of scanning data into Microsoft Purview. Doesn't have read or write access to content in Microsoft Purview beyond those tasks related to scanning.\n\nThese roles are assigned by using the collections where your data sources are registered. You can grant users access to the data they might need without granting them access to the entire data estate. By assigning roles, you can promote resource discoverability while still protecting sensitive information.\n\nNeed help?

In this unit, you learn the core operational theory behind the functioning of Microsoft Purview for mapping and scanning your data sources. The key areas we focus on include how to:\n\nLoad data in the data map.\nBrowse and search information in the data catalog.\nLoad data in the data map\n\nThe Microsoft Purview Data Map is a unified map of your data assets and their relationships. As one cohesive map, it's easier for you and your users to visualize and govern. It also houses the metadata that underpins the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog and Data Estate Insights. The Data Map scales up and down to meet your enterprise compliance requirements. You can use it to govern your data estate in a way that makes the most sense for your business.\n\nSource data\n\nSourcing your data starts with a process where you register data sources. Microsoft Purview supports an array of data sources that span on-premises, multicloud, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) options. You register the various data sources so that Microsoft Purview is aware of them. The data remains in its location and isn't migrated to any other platform.\n\nAfter you have a Microsoft Purview service configured in Azure, you use the Microsoft Purview governance portal to register your data sources.\n\nEach type of data source you choose requires specific information to complete the registration. For example, if your data sources reside in your Azure subscription, you choose the necessary subscription and storage account name. The following image is an example of choosing an Azure Blob Storage source.\n\nAfter registration, you scan the data source. Scanning ingests metadata about your data source into the Microsoft Purview Data Map. Each data source has specific requirements for authenticating and configuration to permit scanning of the assets in that data source.\n\nFor example, if you have data stored in an Amazon S3 standard bucket, you'll need to provide a configuration for the connection. For this service, you use Microsoft Purview to provide a Microsoft account with secure access to AWS, where the Microsoft Purview scanner will run. The Microsoft Purview scanner uses this access to your Amazon S3 buckets to read your data. The scanner then reports the results (including only the metadata and classification) back to Azure. You can use the Microsoft Purview classification and labeling reports to analyze and review your data scan results.\n\n Note\n\nCheck the Microsoft Purview connector for Amazon S3 documentation for region support related to AWS S3 sources.\n\nIn Microsoft Purview, there are a few options to use for authentication when the service needs to scan data sources. Some of these options are:\n\nMicrosoft Purview managed identity\nAccount key (using Azure Key Vault)\nSQL authentication (using Key Vault)\nService principal (using Key Vault)\nMap data\n\nThe data map is the foundational platform for Microsoft Purview. The data map consists of:\n\nData assets.\nData lineage.\nData classifications.\nBusiness context.\n\nCustomers create a knowledge graph of data that comes in from a range of sources. Microsoft Purview makes it easy to register and automatically scan and classify data at scale. Within a data map, you can identify the type of data source, along with other details around security and scanning.\n\nThe data map uses collections to organize these details. Collections are a way of grouping data assets into logical categories to simplify management and discovery of assets within the catalog. You also use collections to manage access to the metadata that's available in the data map.\n\nSelect Map view in the Microsoft Purview governance portal to display the data sources in a graphical view, along with the collections you created for them.\n\nScan data\n\nAfter you register your data sources, you'll need to run a scan to access their metadata and browse the asset information. Before you can scan the data sources, you're required to enter the credentials for these sources. You can use Azure Key Vault to store the credentials for security and ease of access by your scan rules. The Microsoft Purview governance portal comes with existing system scan rule sets that you can select when you create a new scan rule. You can also specify a custom scan rule set.\n\nA scan rule set is a container for grouping scan rules together to use the same rules repeatedly. A scan rule set lets you select file types for schema extraction and classification. It also lets you define new custom file types. You might create a default scan rule set for each of your data source types. Then you can use these scan rule sets by default for all scans within your company.\n\nFor example, you might want to scan only the .csv files in an Azure Data Lake Storage account. Or you might want to check your data only for credit card numbers rather than all the possible classifications. You might also want users with the right permissions to create other scan rule sets with different configurations based on business needs.\n\nClassification\n\nMetadata is used to help describe the data that's being scanned and made available in the catalog. During the configuration of a scan set, you can specify classification rules to apply during the scan that also serve as metadata. The classification rules fall under five major categories:\n\nGovernment: Attributes such as government identity cards, driver license numbers, and passport numbers.\nFinancial: Attributes such as bank account numbers or credit card numbers.\nPersonal: Personal information such as a person's age, date of birth, email address, and phone number.\nSecurity: Attributes like passwords that can be stored.\nMiscellaneous: Attributes not included in the other categories.\n\nYou can use several system classifications to classify your data. These classifications align with the sensitive information types in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. You can also create custom classifications to identify other important or sensitive information types in your data estate.\n\nAfter you register a data source, you can enrich its metadata. With proper access, you can annotate a data source by providing descriptions, ratings, tags, glossary terms, identifying experts, or other metadata for requesting data-source access. This descriptive metadata supplements the structural metadata, such as column names and data types, that's registered from the data source.\n\nDiscovering and understanding data sources and their use is the primary purpose of registering the sources. If you're an enterprise user, you might need data for business intelligence, application development, data science, or any other task where the right data is required. You can use the data catalog discovery experience to quickly find data that matches your needs. You can evaluate the data for its fitness for the purpose and then open the data source in your tool of choice.\n\nAt the same time, you can contribute to the catalog by tagging, documenting, and annotating data sources that have already been registered. You can also register new data sources, which are then discovered, evaluated, and used by the community of catalog users.\n\nBrowse and search\n\nMicrosoft Purview allows you to search information from the data map by using the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog. You can perform text-based search and browse through results by using filters like data source type, tags, ratings, or collection.\n\nYou can use business context to search information from the Microsoft Purview catalog. You can define business glossaries and bulk import existing ones, too. You can also apply business context onto assets in the data map. By using a metamodel, you can define business processes in your environment and associate your data sources with those processes. Users can then apply these business contexts to browse and search for information in the data catalog.\n\nDiscovery enables you to use:\n\nSemantic search and browse.\nBusiness glossary and workflows.\nData lineage with sources, owners, transformations, and lifecycle​.\n\nData lineage\n\nThe concept of data lineage focuses on the lifecycle of data. The lifecycle concerns itself with the various stages data might go through. Data is sourced, moved, and stored throughout its lifecycle. Data might also undergo transformations in the extract, load, and transform/extract, transform, and load (ELT/ETL) operations.\n\nData lineage can offer insights into the data lifecycle by looking at the data pipeline. You can use the lineage to identify the root cause of data issues, perform data quality analysis, and verify compliance.\n\nMicrosoft Purview represents this data lineage in a visual form by showing data movement from source to destination.\n\nNext unit: When to use Microsoft Purview\n\nContinue\n\nNeed help?

You can easily create a broad, up-to-date map of your data landscape with:\n\nAutomated data discovery.\nSensitive data classification.\nEnd-to-end data lineage.\n\nYou can also empower data users to find valuable, trustworthy data.\n\nMicrosoft Purview is designed to help enterprises get the most value from their existing information assets. With this cloud-based service, you can register your data sources to help you discover and manage them. Your data sources remain in place, but a copy of the metadata for the source is added to Microsoft Purview.\n\nYou can register a wide range of sources in Azure and across your multicloud data estate in Microsoft Purview. These sources include Azure Data Lake Storage, AWS, Azure SQL Database on-premises and in the cloud, and many more.\n\nMicrosoft Purview has three main elements:\n\nMicrosoft Purview Data Map: The data map provides a structure for your data estate in Microsoft Purview, where you can map your existing data stores into groups and hierarchies. In the data map, you can grant users and teams access to these groups so that they have access to find relevant data stores. The data map can then scan your data stores and gather metadata such as schemas and data types. It can also identify sensitive data types so that you can keep track of them in your data estate.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Data Catalog: The data catalog allows your users to browse the metadata stored in the data map so that they can find reliable data and understand its context. For example, users can see where the data comes from and who are the experts they can contact about that data source. The data catalog also integrates with other Azure products, like the Azure Synapse Analytics workspace, so that users can search for the data they need from the applications they need it in.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Data Estate Insights: Insights offer a high-level view into your data catalog, covering these key facets:\n\nData stewardship: A report on how curated your data assets are so that you can track your governance progress.\nCatalog adoption: A report on the number of active users in your data catalog, their top searches, and your most viewed assets.\nAsset insights: A report on the data estate and source-type distribution. You can view by source type, classification, and file size. View the insights as a graph or as key performance indicators.\nScan insights: A report that provides information on the health of your scans (successes, failures, or canceled).\nGlossary insights: A status report on the glossary to help users understand the distribution of glossary terms by status, and view how the terms are attached to assets.\nClassification insights: A report that shows where classified data is located. It allows security administrators to understand the types of information found in their organization's data estate.\nSensitivity insights: A report that focuses on sensitivity labels found during scans. Security administrators can make use of this information to ensure security is appropriate for the data estate.\n\nNeed help?

Digital transformation technologies have resulted in new data sources. How do users know what data is available? How do administrators manage data when they might not know what type of data exists and where it's stored? Does the data contain sensitive or personal information?\n\nAll these questions aren't easy to answer without insights into the data and the source of storage. Before you can develop data-governance plans for usage and storage, you need to understand the data your organization uses.\n\nExample scenario\n\nAs a user or producer of data, you might be a business or technical data analyst, data scientist, or data engineer. You probably spend significant time on manual processes to annotate, catalog, and find trusted data sources.\n\nWithout a central location to register data sources, you might be unaware of a data source unless you come into contact with it as part of another process.\n\nWriting metadata descriptions for data sources is often a wasted effort. Client applications typically ignore descriptions that are stored in the data source. Creating documentation for data sources is difficult because you must keep documentation in sync with data sources. Users also might not trust documentation that they think is out of date.\n\nWithout the ability to track data from end to end, you must spend time tracing problems created by data pipelines that other teams own. If you make changes to your datasets, you can accidentally affect related reports that are business or mission critical.\n\nMicrosoft Purview is designed to address these issues and help enterprises get the most value from their existing information assets. Its catalog makes data sources easy to discover and understand by the users who manage the data.\n\nWhat will we be doing?\n\nThis high-level overview of Microsoft Purview helps you discover the key aspects that make it the tool of choice for mapping out your enterprise data. You learn how it can help you:\n\nManage and govern your data across various platforms and locations.\nMap out your data landscape.\nClassify sensitive data.\nEmpower customers to find trustworthy data.\nWhat's the main goal?\n\nBy the end of this session, you'll be able to decide whether Microsoft Purview is the right choice to help you manage your enterprise data environment and your various data sources.\n\nNeed help?

In this unit we'll focus on other equally important aspects, people and process.\n\nScaling analytics and data use across an enterprise isn't possible with just great tools. This requires a cultural shift in which the technology becomes the easy piece to implement. Building a data culture, creating a community of practice, and implementing a data governance strategy are tangible ways to focus on people and process.\n\nJust because there's been a massive increase in data generation over the last decade doesn't inherently mean we've equally increased our use of that data. Building a data culture, building a center of excellence, and supporting analytics practitioners with a community of practice are a few strategies to nurture data use.\n\nBuild a data culture\n\nBuilding a data culture goes well beyond analytics solutions. Building and maintaining a data culture is a key aspect in an organization's digital transformation, and encourages a culture that makes data-informed decisions. Data culture can be defined in different ways, but generally data culture means a set of behaviors and norms in the organization that encourage data informed decision making.\n\nIt's important that you have a well-understood definition of what a healthy data culture means to your organization. This vision of a healthy data culture should:\n\nOriginate from the executive level.\nAlign with organizational objectives.\nDirectly influence your adoption strategy.\nServe as the high-level guiding principles for enacting governance policies and guidelines.\n\nAs an analyst working in a mid-size company, you may have more influence on the data culture than you recognize. Producing useful insights for decision makers often leaves them wanting more, which drives data use. Building a data culture may ideally originate from the executive level but data teams can act as advocates and evangelists.\n\n Tip\n\nLearn more about building a data culture in the Power BI adoption roadmap: data culture\n\nEstablish a Center of Excellence\n\nAn analytics Center of Excellence (COE) is an internal team in your organization whose role is to maximize the potential of analytics in the organization. An analytics COE is a focused initiative to achieve analytics at scale.\n\nAn analytics COE is traditionally made up of both technical and business experts who evangelize the data-driven culture and guide others in the uptake of analytics solutions. COE members provide expert advice to others and serve as a guiding force promoting the uptake of analytics solutions.\n\n Tip\n\nLearn more about how to establish your own Center of Excellence\n\nCommunity of practice\n\nA community of practice is a group of people with a common interest that interacts with, and helps, each other on a voluntary basis. Mastering analytics tools like Power BI creates common interests and encourages individuals across departments and teams to work towards a common goal.\n\nBuilding a community of practice at your organization encourages knowledge sharing and can catalyze the building of a healthy data culture from the ground-up.\n\n Tip\n\nLearn more about building a community of practice in the Power BI adoption roadmap: Community of Practice\n\nBuilding a data culture, building a center of excellence, and supporting analytics practitioners with a community of practice are only a few strategies to ensure that analytics will scale throughout your organization. These, combined with the right technologies will help your organization scale analytics solutions.\n\nNeed help?

This shift is due in part to the sheer volume of data generated that needs to be processed quickly, which wouldn't be possible with a traditional ETL, data warehousing, and reporting approach.\n\nModern analytics takes advantage of advances in computing both on premises and in the cloud. Large in-memory and specialized data stores have become increasingly affordable. These data stores use massively parallel processing, meaning that computations are completed in parallel, distributed across many processors or machines. Distributed processing leads to dramatic improvements in processing time. Additionally, the move to the cloud made it possible to acquire large amounts of computing power that can be turned on and off.\n\nModern analytics at scale\n\nAzure Synapse Analytics is a unified, end-to-end solution for large scale data analytics. It brings together multiple technologies and capabilities, enabling you to combine the data integrity and reliability of a scalable, high-performance SQL Server based relational data warehouse with the flexibility of a data lake and open-source Apache Spark. Azure Synapse Analytics also includes native support for log and telemetry analytics with Azure Synapse Data Explorer pools, as well as built in data pipelines for data ingestion and transformation.\n\nAll Azure Synapse Analytics services can be managed through a single, interactive user interface called Azure Synapse Studio, which includes the ability to create interactive notebooks in which Spark code and markdown content can be combined. Synapse Analytics is a great choice when you want to create a single, unified analytics solution on Azure.\n\nLooking beyond data exploration and into reporting and data use, Power BI and Azure Synapse are natively integrated. Using Power BI with Synapse enables analysts to process large-scale data quickly.\n\n Note\n\nAzure Synapse Analytics and Power BI are not Microsoft's only tools for scaling analytics. They are however the main tools used by data analysts in scalable modern analytics solutions.

In an enterprise, analysts work with data that has been prepared and stored by the data engineer. A data team working together can surface insights from large volumes of data and enable the business to regularly make data-informed decisions.\n\nThe data analyst role can be broad. Analysts may sit in the business, with domain expertise, and focus on producing actionable reports for decision makers quickly. This individual may be referred to as a Power BI data analyst.\n\nAlternatively, an analyst may sit in the IT department, and be responsible for more complex data modeling, with a focus on creating scalable, reusable assets. This individual may be referred to as an enterprise data analyst. The enterprise data analyst may provide technical assistance to the Power BI data analyst.\n\n Note\n\nDepending on the size and makeup of your organization, data analyst roles may look different. There may be distinct roles for data visualization, data modeling, development, and/or administration and governance of the analytics platform. In a different organization, there might be a single person managing all analyst responsbilities.\n\nData analyst tasks\n\nData analysts collect and transform data to generate insights. In addition to digging into and analyzing data, analysts must be able to present data to stakeholders in a way that enables decision making.\n\nAnalyst tasks throughout the analytics process include:\n\nCollect and clean data for analysis\nIngest, transform, and model data in a reporting tool\nGenerate data products, dashboards and reports\nCommunicate findings with relevant stakeholders\nMonitor usage of analytics solution\nGather and incorporate feedback and additional requirements\n\n Note\n\nSee Understand concepts of data analytics for more information on the analytics process.\n\nData analyst tools\n\nThere are hundreds of tools that analysts may use to clean and analyze data. Here, we'll focus on Microsoft tools used in an enterprise analytics solution.\n\nData analysts often use tools like Microsoft Excel, Power BI, and Azure Synapse Analytics to build analytics solutions. Excel may be used for one-off analysis, but when it comes to enterprise analytics solutions analysts are most often querying data from sources like Azure SQL databases or Azure Synapse Analytics.\n\nThe Power BI data analyst and the enterprise analyst will likely use similar tools and have similar skill sets, with one major distinction. An enterprise data analyst will be working with data at scale, and is more likely to be working with tools that can handle larger data.\n\nFor example, it isn't uncommon for companies today to have petabytes of data across the organization. Analyzing and extracting insights from such massive amounts of data used to take hours, if not days. By using tools like Azure Synapse analytics, this processing time can be brought down to minutes. Massive amounts of data are likely to be handled by the enterprise data analyst.\n\nIn addition to technical knowledge of analytics tools, it's critical that analysts have foundational knowledge of relational databases, basic statistics, and data visualization.\n\n Note\n\nLearn more about foundational knowledge at Explore core data concepts.\n\nThe final skill set that makes for a great analyst are soft skills that enable decision making including:\n\nCommunication\nProcess management\nProblem solving\nCollaboration and team work\nCreativity\n\nSuccessful data analysts need a combination of technical and soft skills to solve problems and deliver actionable insights.\n\nNeed help?

The projects often involve hundreds of decisions. Multiple people are typically involved, and each person helps take the project from design to production.\n\nYour organization may define roles differently, or give them different names. The roles described in this unit represent the most common division of tasks and responsibilities.\n\nThese roles are common in modern data projects:\n\nData analyst\nDatabase administrator\nData engineer\nData scientist\nData architect\nData analyst\n\nA data analyst enables businesses to maximize the value of their data assets. They're responsible for exploring data to identify trends, designing and building analytical models, and enabling advanced analytics capabilities through reports and visualizations.\n\nA data analyst processes raw data into relevant insights based on identified business requirements.\n\nDatabase administrator\n\nA database administrator (DBA) is responsible for the design, implementation, maintenance, and operational aspects of on-premises and cloud-based database systems. DBAs are responsible for the overall availability and consistent performance and optimizations of databases. DBAs work with stakeholders to implement policies, tools, and processes for backup and recovery plans to recover following a natural disaster or human-made error.\n\nThe database administrator is also responsible for managing the security of the data in the database, granting privileges over the data, granting or denying access to users as appropriate.\n\nData engineer\n\nData engineers configure data platform technologies that are on-premises and in the cloud. They manage and secure the flow of structured and unstructured data from multiple sources. The data platforms they use can include relational databases, nonrelational databases, data streams, and file stores. Data engineers also ensure that data services securely integrate with other data platform technologies or application services such as Azure Cognitive Services, Azure Search, or even bots.\n\nThe role of data engineer is different from the role of a database administrator. A data engineer's scope of work goes beyond looking after a database and the server where it's hosted. Data engineers must also get, ingest, transform, validate, and clean up data to meet business requirements. This process is called data wrangling.\n\nData scientist\n\nData scientists perform advanced analytics to extract value from data. Their work can vary from descriptive analytics to predictive analytics. Predictive analytics are used in machine learning to apply modeling techniques that can detect anomalies or patterns.\n\nPredictive analytics is just one aspect of data scientists' work. Some data scientists might even work in the realms of deep learning, iteratively experimenting to solve a complex data problem by using customized algorithms.\n\nData architect\n\nData architects are typically responsible for planning and executing an overall data management strategy, including defining standards of data quality and security. They collaborate with other members of the data team to execute the high-level strategy.\n\nData architects must have deep technical knowledge and strong soft skills like effective communication and leadership.\n\nRole differences\n\nThe roles of the data analyst, database administrator, data engineer, data scientist, and data architect differ. Each role solves a different problem and contributes an important part to digital transformation projects.\n\nNext unit: Review tasks and tools for data analysts\n\nContinue\n\nHaving an issue?

Both structured and unstructured data are suitable for analysis, but the tools the data team will use to ingest, transform, and store data will differ according to the data type.\n\nStructured data\n\nStructured data is familiar to most of us. Letters and numbers are organized into columns and rows for simplified search and processing. Structured data is typically quantitative in nature and stored in relational databases and data warehouses. Structured data may reside in something familiar, a Microsoft Excel table. Structured data storage on a larger scale may be stored in a relational database, like an Azure SQL database.\n\nStructured data lends well to all types of analytics and is the most accessible. Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to query relational databases and is commonly used by data analysts, data engineers, and data scientists alike.\n\nPresentation of annual financial data is a common example of using structured data, whether that data is stored in Excel spreadsheets or a relational database like Azure SQL database.\n\nUnstructured data\n\nUnstructured data is information that isn't organized in any discernable manner. Unstructured data is often more suitable for qualitative analysis and is stored in non-relational databases and data lakes.\n\nThe formats of unstructured data vary widely, from Word documents, .csv files, json files, images, and PDFs, to audio and video files. These files would be stored in an Azure Data Lake.\n\nNext unit: Knowledge check\n\nContinue\n\nHaving an issue?

Developing an analytics solution begins before any technology is involved, with a requirements gathering exercise. From there the process continues to ingesting, processing, and exploring data. Analysis and solution deployment are followed by requesting feedback from the business. Finally, the analytics solution is optimized and the process begins again. The analytics process is never done.\n\nHere, you'll learn what steps are included in the data analytics process.\n\nRequirements gathering\n\nData teams work with the business to understand business needs and intended outcomes of an analytics project. Requirements gathering includes identification of:\n\nWhat are the key business questions?\nWhat data are available? Will available data respond to business needs or does more data need to be collected?\nWhat are the essential dimensions - how will stakeholders want to slice and dice the data?\nWhat are the key performance indicators or performance metrics?\nHow will users consume the analysis?\nWhat is the frequency of data ingestion?\nWhat is the frequency of reporting?\n\nIt's a common misunderstanding that a data team will be able to extract insights from volumes of data without having discussed any of the questions above. A data team won't be able to determine the appropriate type of analysis and/or the correct solution without having followed a structured requirements gathering process.\n\nRequirements gathering may take many forms depending on team structure, data volume and velocity, and the type of analysis required.\n\nData ingestion and processing\n\nUsing the requirements gathered from the business, a data team will begin to ingest and transform data.\n\nAzure data services available for ingestion and transformation include, but aren't limited to Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Database, Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Databricks, Azure Data Lake, Azure Event Hubs, and Azure Stream Analytics.\n\nA data engineer is often responsible for the initial ingestion and transformation of data. Data is then surfaced to other members of the data team for exploration and analysis. Azure data services commonly used by enterprise data analysts and data scientists may be limited to specific databases or data lakes.\n\nThe terms Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) or Extract, Load, and Transform (ELT) refer to the process of ingesting and processing data.\n\n Note\n\nLearn more about the ETL process.\n\nData exploration\n\nData exploration is the effort to understand what you're working with, and how that data can respond to the needs of the business. Data exploration can be done in many different tools. At a basic level, the data team might use Excel to look at the contents of a .csv to view the number of records and/or the specific variables they have to explore. Each member of the data team may conduct data profiling in a different tool. An analyst may profile data using Power Query in Power BI, while a data scientist may use Apache Spark in Azure Synapse.\n\nData exploration helps inform required data transformation and cleaning steps, which can be communicated back upstream to the data engineer to build into the analytics solution.\n\nThe analyst may also begin dashboard or report prototyping in the data exploration phase. Understanding how the business wants to see and use the results of the analysis will inform the prototype, along with trends and or insights uncovered during data exploration.\n\nData analysis\n\nAfter data have been explored, data analysis can begin. Analysis can be descriptive, predictive, prescriptive, or even cognitive and can be conducted in many different tools. Results should respond to identified business needs and upon initial review, will likely lead to more questions and analysis.\n\nThere is a difference between a one-off analysis and an analytics solution. Both have their place, and the need for one or the other will be determined during the requirements gathering process.\n\nDeploy analytics solution\n\nResults will be presented to stakeholders in a reporting or data visualization tool like Microsoft Power BI, where people can interact with and use the results of the analysis for decision making.\n\nKey considerations in the deployment of an analytics solution will help determine the right tools, licensing, and permissions needed to get data into the hands of everyone that needs it. Access to timely insights will ultimately lead to data-informed decisions.\n\nRequest and process feedback\n\nDeployment of an analytics solution may feel like a finish line, but it's important to understand the answers to a few key questions.\n\nIs the data product being used?\nDoes the analysis truly respond to the business needs?\nAre there any unforeseen technical issues with the solution?\nIs the data product accessible?\nWhat new business questions does this analysis raise?\n\nThe individuals using your analytics solution are your customers, and if the product you have built doesn't adequately respond to their needs, there's work to be done.\n\nThere are multiple mediums of soliciting feedback. The first launch of a solution may require regular review meetings, whereas monitoring usage metrics of an ongoing project will help you understand usage over time and even areas of your solution that are and aren't useful.\n\nOptimize solution\n\nImplementing the feedback of your users is a logical first step to optimize your analytics solution. There may also be opportunities to remove latency in the process, for example, ensuring the data refresh occurs in the allotted time. Optimization could also mean more accurately reflecting user needs by tweaking visual design or ensuring report visuals render quickly.\n\nBegin again\n\nThe analytics process is cyclical by nature. Exposing data and insights often leads to requests for more analysis, which leads to more feedback, and so on. On a large data team, the analytics process may occur in short sprints, where different team members work simultaneously to achieve small goals before moving onto the next step in the process. On smaller teams, one person may be acting in multiple roles, which would make the process look different.\n\nRegardless of what the process looks like for you, communication is a critical component throughout. The data team must communicate with each other and be in dialogue with the business, to ensure solution development is responding to business needs and needs that may appear in the data.\n\nNeed help?

These activities are categorized as descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, prescriptive, and cognitive analytics.\n\nIn this unit, you'll learn about these five categories of data analytics and what they are used for.\n\nDescriptive analytics\nWhat happened?\n\nDescriptive analytics answers questions about what happened, based on historical data, to inform decisions about the future. Descriptive analytics techniques summarize large datasets to present insights to stakeholders. Descriptive analytics is the most common type of analytics and is often performed by a data analyst.\n\nThe development of key performance indicators (KPIs) and other performance measures helps track the success or failure of business objectives. KPIs and performance metrics are often set by the business to track key initiatives. The presentation of data related to those KPIs is descriptive analytics.\n\nDescriptive analytics outputs can take many forms, including reports and dashboards. The Sales and Marketing report below displays sales and marketing data for a year by product, channel, and over time.\n\nDiagnostic analytics\nWhy did it happen?\n\nDiagnostic analytics helps answer questions about why things happened and is often the next step in data analytics after descriptive analytics. Analysts take findings from descriptive analytics and dig deeper to find the cause. Metrics and indicators of interest are further investigated to discover why they got better or worse. Diagnostic analytics is often performed by data analysts and data scientists.\n\nDiagnostic analytics generally occurs in three steps:\n\nIdentify anomalies in the data. Anomalies may be unexpected changes in a metric or a particular market.\nCollect data that's related to these anomalies.\nUse statistical techniques to discover relationships and trends that explain these anomalies.\n\nIn Contoso's sales report below, we want to understand why Contoso is or isn't winning bids for new business. Diagnostic analytics help decision makers see that applying discounts of 2% increases the likelihood of winning a bid.\n\nPredictive analytics\nWhat will happen in the future?\n\nPredictive analytics helps answer questions about what will happen in the future. Predictive analytics techniques use historical data to identify trends and determine if they're likely to recur, providing insight into what may happen in the future. Techniques include statistical and machine learning techniques such as forecasting, neural networks, decision trees, and regression. Predictive analytics is often performed by data scientists.\n\nThe line chart below looks at revenue won by year and month, which shows historical decline. Forecasting predicts that revenue won will continue to decrease. Decision makers may use this forecast to change course in an effort to increase the amount of revenue won.\n\nPrescriptive analytics\nWhat actions should be taken?\n\nPrescriptive analytics takes predictive analytics one step further and helps answer questions about what actions should be taken to achieve a goal or target. This technique allows businesses to make data-informed decisions in the face of uncertainty. Prescriptive analytics techniques rely on machine learning strategies to find patterns in large datasets. By analyzing past decisions and events, the likelihood of different outcomes can be estimated. Prescriptive analytics is often performed by data scientists. Microsoft also provides low-code tools that can be used by analysts to conduct prescriptive analytics, like using machine learning in Power BI.\n\nAlgorithmic content recommendations are a common implementation of prescriptive analytics. Using the recommendation algorithm in Azure Machine Learning studio, data scientists can recommend the best actions Contoso should take based on a customer's past habit and characteristics. The screenshot below displays the recommendation algorithm in Azure Machine Learning designer, in which customer data is being used to prescribe a specific recommendation rating.\n\n Note\n\nTo learn more about prescriptive analytics using Azure Machine Learning, review Build a content-based recommendation system.\n\nCognitive analytics\nHow can the problem be solved best?\n\nCognitive analytics combines artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics approaches to guide decision making. Cognitive analytics draws inferences from existing data and patterns, derives conclusions based on existing knowledge bases, and adds findings back into the knowledge base for future inferences--a self-learning feedback loop. This feedback loop enables cognitive applications to become more precise over time.\n\nBy tapping the benefits of massive parallel/distributed computing and the falling costs of data storage and computing power, there's no limit to the cognitive development that these systems can achieve. Microsoft's Azure AI Services enables users to take advantage of cognitive analytics by extracting insights from various types of data, including things like text and images.\n\n Note\n\nTo learn more about data cognitive analytics using Azure AI Services, review Get started with Azure AI Services.\n\nNeed help?

Presentation of insights for decision making is the end goal of a larger analytics project. Data analysts present findings to decision makers in the form of a data product, like a dashboard or report.\n\nAzure data analytics and reporting\n\nThere are many options for analytics and reporting in Azure, depending on the needs of the business. Analysts can explore and visualize data directly in the Azure ecosystem, using tools like Synapse notebooks in Azure Synapse Analytics. Analysts can also build and deploy solutions for use by others using robust reporting tools like Microsoft Power BI.\n\nExplore and visualize data in Azure Synapse Analytics\n\nAzure Synapse Analytics provides a suite of tools to process and analyze an organization's data. It incorporates SQL technologies, Transact-SQL query capabilities, and open-source Spark tools to enable you to quickly process very large amounts of data. Data exploration in Azure Synapse Studio may be the first step in the analytics process, where you can profile and examine data.\n\nData can be explored and visualized directly in Azure Synapse Studio using the Azure Synapse SQL results pane and using native visuals in Spark notebooks. Simple visualizations of your data make it easier to detect patterns, trends, and outliers, and may help you understand what your next steps in analysis will be.\n\nSynapse Studio provides a SQL script web interface for you to author SQL queries. You can also visualize your SQL script results in a chart by selecting the Chart button.\n\nSynapse notebooks enable you to analyze data across raw formats (CSV, txt, JSON, etc.), processed file formats (parquet, Delta Lake, ORC, etc.), and SQL tabular data files against Spark and SQL.\n\n Note\n\nLearn more about large-scale data analytics in Azure Synapse Analytics.\n\nVisualize data and create reporting solutions using Microsoft Power BI\n\nPower BI is an enterprise analytics tool that can help you discover and distribute insights from data stored in Azure and beyond. Azure and Power BI can be used together to connect, combine, and analyze your entire data estate. With Power BI, you can create reports with interactive visualizations to drive decision making.\n\nData visualization in Power BI helps you turn large amounts of granular data into easily understood, visually compelling, and useful business information. The use of Power BI takes the data exploration you may have done in Azure Synapse Analytics a step further. In addition to the enhanced visualization capability, Power BI also provides a platform for secure distribution of dashboards and reports.\n\nPower BI also has native connectors to many Azure data services.
