If Azure Synapse Studio is massively deployed in your organization, you can get the data catalog experience directly in Azure Synapse Studio.\n\nThis integrated experience allows you to discover Microsoft Purview assets, interact with them through Synapse capabilities, and push lineage information to Microsoft Purview.\n\n Note\n\nTo connect an Microsoft Purview Account to a Synapse workspace, you need 2 types of permissions. You need a contributor role in Synapse workspace from Azure portal identity and access management (IAM). You also need access to that Microsoft Purview Account. For more information, see Microsoft Purview permissions.\n\nLet’s imagine you need to find and understand some assets before working with them in pipelines or notebooks. From Azure Synapse Studio, you can easily query your Microsoft Purview data catalog.\n\nIn Azure Synapse Studio, from the Data blade on the left, select Purview in the dropdown next to the search bar.\n\nSearch for the asset that exists in Purview. Imagine you're looking for movie files. Enter the keyword movie in the search bar, and fine tune your search by selecting Files as the object type and Raw as the collection.\n\nSelect the first asset “Movies.csv” to get asset details. Because you are in Azure Synapse Studio, you can also leverage Azure Synapse capabilities.\n\nFor instance, you can use Azure Synapse serverless to query your assets. Select Develop, New SQL Script and Select top 100.\n\nDouble check you're connected to your serveless instance and select Run to execute the script and get an overview of your data.\n\nAfter reviewing data, you can use the asset, for example, adding to a new dataflow in Azure Synapse.\n\n Note\n\nSee Connect an Microsoft Purview Account for detailed information about integrating Microsoft Purview into Azure Synapse Analytics.\n\nNeed help?

Often, you may not know how your data estate is structured. The Microsoft Purview data catalog offers a browse experience that enables exploration of available data, either by collection or by exploring the hierarchy of each data source in the catalog.\n\nBrowse by collection or source type\n\nIf you're new to an organization or department, you may want to familiarize yourself with the contents of the data estate. From the Microsoft Purview Studio home page, select the “Browse assets” tile to browse either by collection or by source type.\n\nHere you can specify whether you'd like to browse by collection or by source type.\n\nBrowse by collection allows you to explore the different collections you're a data reader or curator for. You'll only see collections you have access to. Select a collection to get a list of assets in that collection with the facets and filters available in search.\n\n Tip\n\nCollections are a tool to manage ownership and access control across assets and data sources. They also organize assets and sources into categories that are customized to match the business flow. See Create and manage collections in Microsoft Purview to learn more.\n\nBrowse by source type allows you to explore the hierarchies of data sources using an explorer view.\n\nAfter selecting a tile associated with a data source type, you'll see a list of assets belonging to that type. From there, you'll be able to use the explorer view to see parent and child assets.\n\nThe Microsoft Purview data catalog browse experience enables analysts or data consumers to explore what data is available in many different ways. Microsoft Purview has the ability to enable users access to data you may not have known about before.

This central place, Microsoft Purview data catalog, provides advanced search capabilities to quickly find the right assets and information. Using keywords, business terms and Microsoft Purview data catalog functionalities, you can find the assets needed to build and design reports.\n\nAs a data analyst looking for assets, you'll be searching the Microsoft Purview data catalog. This assumes that the Microsoft Purview data Map has been created by your organization. The data map provides the foundation for data discovery. The data map captures metadata about enterprise data in analytics and operations systems on-premises and in the cloud and must be established before the data catalog can be searched.\n\n Note\n\nLearn more about the Microsoft Purview data map components.\n\nSearch the Microsoft Purview data catalog\n\nFrom the Microsoft Purview Studio home page, users can type relevant keywords to start discovering assets. In this scenario, you're looking for “product sales.”\n\nThe screenshot below displays the search result, with all assets corresponding to the keywords entered in the search engine.\n\nYou can fine-tune your search using the filters on the left side of the page.\n\nYou can filter by:\n\nSource type (and instance if needed)\nObject type\nClassification\nGlossary term\nIf needed, more options are available like Collection, Contact and Label\n\nYou've been instructed to connect to sources like Azure SQL tables. In the result displayed below, two assets are displayed. To use the correct asset, it’s possible to browse each asset to dig for more detailed information. Alternatively, you can rely on the work done by the data stewards who have labeled certified assets for the organization.\n\nBefore using this asset to create your report, you need to verify more details and validate where data comes from to populate this asset. Select the asset to access more information.\n\nUnderstand a single asset\nAsset overview\n\nSelect an asset to see the overview. The overview displays information at a glance, including a description, asset classification, schema classification, collection path, asset hierarchy, and glossary terms.\n\nThe asset description provides a brief explanation of the purpose of an asset. Data stewards have made data analysts lives easier in the screenshot below, by noting that this is the correct resource to use for sales reporting.\n\nBeneath the description, you'll see the asset classification and schema classification.\n\nData classification, in the context of Microsoft Purview, is a way of categorizing data assets by assigning unique logical labels or classes. Classification is based on the business context of the data. For example, you might classify assets by Passport Number, Driver's License Number, Credit Card Number, SWIFT Code, Person’s Name, and so on. Asset classifications can be automatically applied during a scan or applied manually.\n\n Note\n\nMicrosoft Purview comes with more than 200 classifications out of the box. For a full list of classifications, see System classifications in Microsoft Purview.\n\nThe overview tab reflects both asset level classifications and column level classifications that have been applied, which you can also view as part of the schema.\n\n Important\n\nYou may notice that the classifications displayed above are sensitive or contain personally identifiable information (PII). data encryption is done at the source level, and Microsoft Purview stores only the metadata. It does not preview data.\n\nYou can also view the collection path, hierarchy and glossary terms on the right side of the overview tab.\n\nThe collection path refers to the location of the asset inside Microsoft Purview. You have the option to move an asset to another collection.\n\nYou can view the full asset hierarchy within the overview tab. As an example: if you navigate to a SQL table, then you can see the schema, database, and the server the table belongs to.\n\nGlossary terms are a managed vocabulary for business terms that can be used to categorize and relate assets across your environment. For example, terms like 'customer,' 'buyer, 'cost center,' or any terms that give your data context for your users. You can view the glossary terms for an asset in the overview section, and you can add a glossary term on an asset by editing the asset.\n\n Note\n\nFor more information, see the business glossary page.\n\nAsset schema\n\nThe schema view of the asset includes more granular details about the asset, such as column names, data types, column level classifications, terms, and descriptions.\n\nAsset lineage\n\nAsset lineage gives you a clear view of how the asset is populated and where data comes from. Data lineage is broadly understood as the lifecycle that spans the data's origin, and where it moves over time across the data estate. Data lineage is important to analysts because it enables understanding of where data is coming from, what upstream changes may have occurred, and how it flows through the enterprise data systems.\n\nA single view on the asset lineage tab displays the data flow to and from the asset. Asset lineage can also help you understand how the asset was built and how the asset is used inside the organization.\n\nThe columns pane on the left side of the lineage tab allows users to select and track columns as they flow through the lineage. For example, if you select the column Full Name, you can see how the Full Name field was created and where the information comes from.\n\n Note\n\nThe lineage view is a powerful way to understand the transformation process an asset has undergone. Learn more about the lineage experience in Microsoft Purview data catalog\n\nAsset contacts and related assets\n\nAsset contacts provide you contact details of experts or dataset owners with any questions. As a new analyst searching for the right data sources for your report, you may find these individuals helpful.\n\nIf needed, you can also navigate through the technical hierarchy of assets that are related to the current asset you're viewing.\n\nThe ability to search the Microsoft Purview data catalog has the potential to break down data silos and enable the next level of enterprise analytics.\n\nNeed help?

The criteria that indicate whether Microsoft Purview will meet your requirements are:\n\nDiscovery\nGovernance\n\nLet's take a look at these criteria and see how Microsoft Purview can help address their needs.\n\nDiscovery\n\nWithout a central location to register data sources, you might be unaware of a data source unless you come into contact with it as part of another process.\n\nUnless you know the location of a data source, you can't connect to the data by using a client application. You're required to know the connection string or path.\n\nThe intended use of the data is hidden to you unless you know the location of a data source's documentation. Data sources and documentation might live in several places and be utilized through different kinds of experiences.\n\nGovernance\n\nAs the data in your organization grows, the task of discovering, protecting, and governing that data becomes more difficult. Data is stored in different locations, which might be required for compliance reasons. The data might contain sensitive information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, or other personal information.\n\nCompliance with company security policies, government regulations, and customer needs are critical considerations for data governance. Understanding which data sources contain sensitive information is key to knowing where protections are needed and how to guard against access to this sensitive data.\n\nApply the criteria\n\nLet's take a look at how Microsoft Purview can address the data discovery and governance criteria.\n\nDoes Microsoft Purview help with data discovery?\n\nDo you require a solution or centralized location to register data sources? Often, users might be unaware of a data source unless they come into contact with it as part of another process. Microsoft Purview can help provide a solution.\n\nAfter you've registered data sources in the Microsoft Purview governance portal and displayed them in the data map, you can set up scanning of those data sources. The metadata that's returned catalogs the data in those sources. In this way, it's easier for users to discover what the data sources contain. The metadata is indexed to make each data source easy to discover via search. It's also more understandable to the users who discover it.\n\nUsers can contribute to the catalog by tagging, documenting, and annotating data sources that have already been registered. They can register new data sources so that other catalog users can discover, understand, and utilize them.\n\nDoes Microsoft Purview help with data governance?\n\nMicrosoft Purview can scan and automatically classify data in files and tables. Microsoft Purview classifies data by Bloom Filter and RegEx. Bloom Filter classifications include attributes for city, country/region, place, and person information. RegEx classifications cover attributes that include categories like bank information (ABA routing numbers or country/region-specific banking account numbers), passport numbers, and country/region-specific identification numbers. You can find the full list of supported classifications in the documentation for Microsoft Purview.\n\nMicrosoft Purview also uses predefined Data Plane roles to help control who has access to the information in Microsoft Purview. For access, users can use the Microsoft Purview governance portal only if they're placed in at least one of the three supported roles. When a Microsoft Purview account is created, no one but the creator can access the account or use its APIs. New users must be put in one or more of the following roles:\n\nPurview Data Reader role: Has access to the Microsoft Purview governance portal and can read all content in Microsoft Purview except for scan bindings.\nPurview Data Curator role: Has access to the Microsoft Purview governance portal and can read all content in Microsoft Purview except for scan bindings. Can edit information about assets, classification definitions, and glossary terms. Can also apply classifications and glossary terms to assets.\nPurview Data Source Administrator role: Doesn't have access to the Microsoft Purview governance portal (unless the user is also in the Data Reader or Data Curator roles). Can manage all aspects of scanning data into Microsoft Purview. Doesn't have read or write access to content in Microsoft Purview beyond those tasks related to scanning.\n\nThese roles are assigned by using the collections where your data sources are registered. You can grant users access to the data they might need without granting them access to the entire data estate. By assigning roles, you can promote resource discoverability while still protecting sensitive information.\n\nNeed help?

In this unit, you learn the core operational theory behind the functioning of Microsoft Purview for mapping and scanning your data sources. The key areas we focus on include how to:\n\nLoad data in the data map.\nBrowse and search information in the data catalog.\nLoad data in the data map\n\nThe Microsoft Purview Data Map is a unified map of your data assets and their relationships. As one cohesive map, it's easier for you and your users to visualize and govern. It also houses the metadata that underpins the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog and Data Estate Insights. The Data Map scales up and down to meet your enterprise compliance requirements. You can use it to govern your data estate in a way that makes the most sense for your business.\n\nSource data\n\nSourcing your data starts with a process where you register data sources. Microsoft Purview supports an array of data sources that span on-premises, multicloud, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) options. You register the various data sources so that Microsoft Purview is aware of them. The data remains in its location and isn't migrated to any other platform.\n\nAfter you have a Microsoft Purview service configured in Azure, you use the Microsoft Purview governance portal to register your data sources.\n\nEach type of data source you choose requires specific information to complete the registration. For example, if your data sources reside in your Azure subscription, you choose the necessary subscription and storage account name. The following image is an example of choosing an Azure Blob Storage source.\n\nAfter registration, you scan the data source. Scanning ingests metadata about your data source into the Microsoft Purview Data Map. Each data source has specific requirements for authenticating and configuration to permit scanning of the assets in that data source.\n\nFor example, if you have data stored in an Amazon S3 standard bucket, you'll need to provide a configuration for the connection. For this service, you use Microsoft Purview to provide a Microsoft account with secure access to AWS, where the Microsoft Purview scanner will run. The Microsoft Purview scanner uses this access to your Amazon S3 buckets to read your data. The scanner then reports the results (including only the metadata and classification) back to Azure. You can use the Microsoft Purview classification and labeling reports to analyze and review your data scan results.\n\n Note\n\nCheck the Microsoft Purview connector for Amazon S3 documentation for region support related to AWS S3 sources.\n\nIn Microsoft Purview, there are a few options to use for authentication when the service needs to scan data sources. Some of these options are:\n\nMicrosoft Purview managed identity\nAccount key (using Azure Key Vault)\nSQL authentication (using Key Vault)\nService principal (using Key Vault)\nMap data\n\nThe data map is the foundational platform for Microsoft Purview. The data map consists of:\n\nData assets.\nData lineage.\nData classifications.\nBusiness context.\n\nCustomers create a knowledge graph of data that comes in from a range of sources. Microsoft Purview makes it easy to register and automatically scan and classify data at scale. Within a data map, you can identify the type of data source, along with other details around security and scanning.\n\nThe data map uses collections to organize these details. Collections are a way of grouping data assets into logical categories to simplify management and discovery of assets within the catalog. You also use collections to manage access to the metadata that's available in the data map.\n\nSelect Map view in the Microsoft Purview governance portal to display the data sources in a graphical view, along with the collections you created for them.\n\nScan data\n\nAfter you register your data sources, you'll need to run a scan to access their metadata and browse the asset information. Before you can scan the data sources, you're required to enter the credentials for these sources. You can use Azure Key Vault to store the credentials for security and ease of access by your scan rules. The Microsoft Purview governance portal comes with existing system scan rule sets that you can select when you create a new scan rule. You can also specify a custom scan rule set.\n\nA scan rule set is a container for grouping scan rules together to use the same rules repeatedly. A scan rule set lets you select file types for schema extraction and classification. It also lets you define new custom file types. You might create a default scan rule set for each of your data source types. Then you can use these scan rule sets by default for all scans within your company.\n\nFor example, you might want to scan only the .csv files in an Azure Data Lake Storage account. Or you might want to check your data only for credit card numbers rather than all the possible classifications. You might also want users with the right permissions to create other scan rule sets with different configurations based on business needs.\n\nClassification\n\nMetadata is used to help describe the data that's being scanned and made available in the catalog. During the configuration of a scan set, you can specify classification rules to apply during the scan that also serve as metadata. The classification rules fall under five major categories:\n\nGovernment: Attributes such as government identity cards, driver license numbers, and passport numbers.\nFinancial: Attributes such as bank account numbers or credit card numbers.\nPersonal: Personal information such as a person's age, date of birth, email address, and phone number.\nSecurity: Attributes like passwords that can be stored.\nMiscellaneous: Attributes not included in the other categories.\n\nYou can use several system classifications to classify your data. These classifications align with the sensitive information types in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. You can also create custom classifications to identify other important or sensitive information types in your data estate.\n\nAfter you register a data source, you can enrich its metadata. With proper access, you can annotate a data source by providing descriptions, ratings, tags, glossary terms, identifying experts, or other metadata for requesting data-source access. This descriptive metadata supplements the structural metadata, such as column names and data types, that's registered from the data source.\n\nDiscovering and understanding data sources and their use is the primary purpose of registering the sources. If you're an enterprise user, you might need data for business intelligence, application development, data science, or any other task where the right data is required. You can use the data catalog discovery experience to quickly find data that matches your needs. You can evaluate the data for its fitness for the purpose and then open the data source in your tool of choice.\n\nAt the same time, you can contribute to the catalog by tagging, documenting, and annotating data sources that have already been registered. You can also register new data sources, which are then discovered, evaluated, and used by the community of catalog users.\n\nBrowse and search\n\nMicrosoft Purview allows you to search information from the data map by using the Microsoft Purview Data Catalog. You can perform text-based search and browse through results by using filters like data source type, tags, ratings, or collection.\n\nYou can use business context to search information from the Microsoft Purview catalog. You can define business glossaries and bulk import existing ones, too. You can also apply business context onto assets in the data map. By using a metamodel, you can define business processes in your environment and associate your data sources with those processes. Users can then apply these business contexts to browse and search for information in the data catalog.\n\nDiscovery enables you to use:\n\nSemantic search and browse.\nBusiness glossary and workflows.\nData lineage with sources, owners, transformations, and lifecycle​.\n\nData lineage\n\nThe concept of data lineage focuses on the lifecycle of data. The lifecycle concerns itself with the various stages data might go through. Data is sourced, moved, and stored throughout its lifecycle. Data might also undergo transformations in the extract, load, and transform/extract, transform, and load (ELT/ETL) operations.\n\nData lineage can offer insights into the data lifecycle by looking at the data pipeline. You can use the lineage to identify the root cause of data issues, perform data quality analysis, and verify compliance.\n\nMicrosoft Purview represents this data lineage in a visual form by showing data movement from source to destination.\n\nNeed help?

You can easily create a broad, up-to-date map of your data landscape with:\n\nAutomated data discovery.\nSensitive data classification.\nEnd-to-end data lineage.\n\nYou can also empower data users to find valuable, trustworthy data.\n\nMicrosoft Purview is designed to help enterprises get the most value from their existing information assets. With this cloud-based service, you can register your data sources to help you discover and manage them. Your data sources remain in place, but a copy of the metadata for the source is added to Microsoft Purview.\n\nYou can register a wide range of sources in Azure and across your multicloud data estate in Microsoft Purview. These sources include Azure Data Lake Storage, AWS, Azure SQL Database on-premises and in the cloud, and many more.\n\nMicrosoft Purview has three main elements:\n\nMicrosoft Purview Data Map: The data map provides a structure for your data estate in Microsoft Purview, where you can map your existing data stores into groups and hierarchies. In the data map, you can grant users and teams access to these groups so that they have access to find relevant data stores. The data map can then scan your data stores and gather metadata such as schemas and data types. It can also identify sensitive data types so that you can keep track of them in your data estate.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Data Catalog: The data catalog allows your users to browse the metadata stored in the data map so that they can find reliable data and understand its context. For example, users can see where the data comes from and who are the experts they can contact about that data source. The data catalog also integrates with other Azure products, like the Azure Synapse Analytics workspace, so that users can search for the data they need from the applications they need it in.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Data Estate Insights: Insights offer a high-level view into your data catalog, covering these key facets:\n\nData stewardship: A report on how curated your data assets are so that you can track your governance progress.\nCatalog adoption: A report on the number of active users in your data catalog, their top searches, and your most viewed assets.\nAsset insights: A report on the data estate and source-type distribution. You can view by source type, classification, and file size. View the insights as a graph or as key performance indicators.\nScan insights: A report that provides information on the health of your scans (successes, failures, or canceled).\nGlossary insights: A status report on the glossary to help users understand the distribution of glossary terms by status, and view how the terms are attached to assets.\nClassification insights: A report that shows where classified data is located. It allows security administrators to understand the types of information found in their organization's data estate.\nSensitivity insights: A report that focuses on sensitivity labels found during scans. Security administrators can make use of this information to ensure security is appropriate for the data estate.\n\nNeed help?

Digital transformation technologies have resulted in new data sources. How do users know what data is available? How do administrators manage data when they might not know what type of data exists and where it's stored? Does the data contain sensitive or personal information?\n\nAll these questions aren't easy to answer without insights into the data and the source of storage. Before you can develop data-governance plans for usage and storage, you need to understand the data your organization uses.\n\nExample scenario\n\nAs a user or producer of data, you might be a business or technical data analyst, data scientist, or data engineer. You probably spend significant time on manual processes to annotate, catalog, and find trusted data sources.\n\nWithout a central location to register data sources, you might be unaware of a data source unless you come into contact with it as part of another process.\n\nWriting metadata descriptions for data sources is often a wasted effort. Client applications typically ignore descriptions that are stored in the data source. Creating documentation for data sources is difficult because you must keep documentation in sync with data sources. Users also might not trust documentation that they think is out of date.\n\nWithout the ability to track data from end to end, you must spend time tracing problems created by data pipelines that other teams own. If you make changes to your datasets, you can accidentally affect related reports that are business or mission critical.\n\nMicrosoft Purview is designed to address these issues and help enterprises get the most value from their existing information assets. Its catalog makes data sources easy to discover and understand by the users who manage the data.\n\nWhat will we be doing?\n\nThis high-level overview of Microsoft Purview helps you discover the key aspects that make it the tool of choice for mapping out your enterprise data. You learn how it can help you:\n\nManage and govern your data across various platforms and locations.\nMap out your data landscape.\nClassify sensitive data.\nEmpower customers to find trustworthy data.\nWhat's the main goal?\n\nBy the end of this session, you'll be able to decide whether Microsoft Purview is the right choice to help you manage your enterprise data environment and your various data sources.\n\nNeed help?

A simple query that forwards event data from an event hub directly to Power BI might look something like this:\n\nSELECT\n    EventEnqueuedUtcTime AS ReadingTime,\n    SensorID,\n    ReadingValue\nINTO\n    [powerbi-output]\nFROM\n    [eventhub-input] TIMESTAMP BY EventEnqueuedUtcTime\n\n\nThe results of the query determine the schema of the table in the output dataset in Power BI.\n\nAlternatively, you might use your query to filter and/or aggregate the data, sending only relevant or summarized data to the Power BI dataset. For example, the following query calculates the maximum reading for each sensor other than sensor 0 for each consecutive minute in which an event occurs.\n\nSELECT\n    DateAdd(second, -60, System.TimeStamp) AS StartTime,\n    System.TimeStamp AS EndTime,\n    SensorID,\n    MAX(ReadingValue) AS MaxReading\nINTO\n    [powerbi-output]\nFROM\n    [eventhub-input] TIMESTAMP BY EventEnqueuedUtcTime\nWHERE SensorID <> 0\nGROUP BY SensorID, TumblingWindow(second, 60)\nHAVING COUNT(*) > 1\n\n\nWhen working with window functions (such as the TumblingWindow function in the previous example), consider that Power BI is capable of handling a call every second.

In most cases, inputs reference sources of streaming data (though you can also define inputs for static reference data to augment the streamed event data). Outputs determine where the results of the stream processing query will be sent. To support real-time data visualization, you can use a Power BI output.\n\nStreaming data inputs\n\nInputs for streaming data consumed by Azure Stream Analytics can include:\n\nAzure Event Hubs\nAzure IoT Hubs\nAzure Blob or Data Lake Gen 2 Storage\n\nDepending on the specific input type, the data for each streamed event includes the event's data fields and input-specific metadata fields. For example, data consumed from an Azure Event Hubs input includes an EventEnqueuedUtcTime field indicating the time when the event was received in the event hub.\n\n Note\n\nFor more information about streaming inputs, see Stream data as input into Stream Analytics in the Azure Stream Analytics documentation.\n\nPower BI outputs\n\nYou can use a Power BI output to write the results of a Stream Analytics query to a table in a Power BI streaming dataset, from where it can be visualized in a dashboard. When adding a Power BI output to a Stream Analytics job, you need to specify the following properties:\n\nOutput alias: A name for the output that can be used in a query.\nGroup workspace: The Power BI workspace in which you want to create the resulting dataset.\nDataset name: The name of the dataset to be generated by the output. You shouldn't pre-create this dataset as it will be created automatically (replacing any existing dataset with the same name).\nTable name: The name of the table to be created in the dataset.\nAuthorize connection: You must authenticate the connection to your Power BI tenant so that the Stream Analytics job can write data to the workspace.\n\n Note\n\nFor more information about Power BI outputs, see Power BI output from Azure Stream Analytics in the Azure Stream Analytics documentation.\n\nNeed help?

Once started, the query will run perpetually until stopped; constantly ingesting new event data into your Azure Synapse Analytics workspace (into a table in relational data warehouse or files in a data lake, depending on the output type).\n\nWorking with ingested data\n\nYou can work with the ingested streaming data like any other data in Azure Synapse Analytics, combining it with data ingested using batch processing techniques or synchronized from operational data sources by using Azure Synapse Link.\n\nQuerying data in a relational data warehouse\n\nIf you used an Azure Synapse Analytics output to ingest the results of your stream processing job into a table in a dedicated SQL pool, you can query the table using a SQL query, just like any other table. The results of the query will always include the latest data to be ingested at the time the query is run. Your data warehouse can include tables for streaming data as well as tables for batch ingested data, enabling you to join real-time and batch data for historical analytics.\n\nFor example, the following SQL code could be used to query a table named factSensorReadings that contains the results of stream processing, and combine it with a dimDate table containing detailed data about the dates on which readings were captured.\n\nSELECT d.Weekday, s.SensorID, AVG(s.SensorReading) AS AverageReading\nFROM factSensorReadings AS s\nJOIN dimDate AS d\n    ON CAST(s.ReadingTime AS DATE) = d.DateKey\nGROUP BY d.Weekday, s.SensorID\n\n\n Tip\n\nTo Learn more about using a dedicated SQL pool to analyze data in a data warehouse, see the Analyze data in a relational data warehouse module on Microsoft Learn.\n\nQuerying data in a data lake\n\nAs streaming data is ingested into files in a data lake, you can query those files by using a serverless SQL pool in Azure Synapse Analytics. For example, the following query reads all fields from all Parquet files under the sensors folder in the data file system container.\n\nSELECT *\nFROM OPENROWSET(\n    BULK 'https://mydatalake.blob.core.windows.net/data/sensors/*',\n    FORMAT = 'parquet') AS rows\n\n\n Tip\n\nTo Learn more about using serverless SQL pools to query files in a data lake, see the Use Azure Synapse serverless SQL pool to query files in a data lake module on Microsoft Learn.\n\nYou can also query the data lake by using code running in an Apache Spark pool, as shown in this example:\n\n%%pyspark\ndf = spark.read.load('abfss://data@datalake.dfs.core.windows.net/sensors/*', format='parquet'\n)\ndisplay(df)\n\n\n Tip\n\nTo Learn more about using Apache Spark pools to query files in a data lake, see the Analyze data with Apache Spark in Azure Synapse Analytics module on Microsoft Learn.\n\nNeed help?

You can use AS clauses to rename fields, and cast them to alternative (compatible) data types as necessary.\n\nFiltering event data\n\nIn some cases, you might want to filter the data to include only specific events by adding a WHERE clause. For example, the following query writes data only for events with a negative ReadingValue field value.\n\nSELECT\n    EventEnqueuedUtcTime AS ReadingTime,\n    SensorID,\n    ReadingValue\nINTO\n    [synapse-output]\nFROM\n    [streaming-input] TIMESTAMP BY EventEnqueuedUtcTime\nWHERE ReadingValue < 0\n\nAggregating events over temporal windows\n\nA common pattern for streaming queries is to aggregate event data over temporal (time-based) intervals, or windows. To accomplish this, you can use a GROUP BY clause that includes a Window function defining the kind of window you want to define (for example, tumbling, hopping, or sliding).\n\n Tip\n\nFor more information about window functions, see Introduction to Stream Analytics windowing functions in the Azure Stream Analytics documentation.\n\nThe following example groups streaming sensor readings into 1 minute tumbling (serial, non-overlapping) windows, recording the start and end time of each window and the maximum reading for each sensor. The HAVING clause filters the results to include only windows where at least one event occurred.\n\nSELECT\n    DateAdd(second, -60, System.TimeStamp) AS StartTime,\n    System.TimeStamp AS EndTime,\n    SensorID,\n    MAX(ReadingValue) AS MaxReading\nINTO\n    [synapse-output]\nFROM\n    [streaming-input] TIMESTAMP BY EventEnqueuedUtcTime\nGROUP BY SensorID, TumblingWindow(second, 60)\nHAVING COUNT(*) >= 1\n\n\n Tip\n\nFor more information about common patters for queries, see Common query patterns in Azure Stream Analytics in the Azure Stream Analytics documentation.\n\nNeed help?

In most cases, inputs reference sources of streaming data (though you can also define inputs for static reference data to augment the streamed event data). Outputs determine where the results of the stream processing query will be sent. In the case of data ingestion into Azure Synapse Analytics, the output usually references an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 container or a table in a dedicated SQL pool database.\n\nStreaming data inputs\n\nInputs for streaming data consumed by Azure Stream Analytics can include:\n\nAzure Event Hubs\nAzure IoT Hubs\nAzure Blob or Data Lake Gen 2 Storage\n\nDepending on the specific input type, the data for each streamed event includes the event's data fields as well as input-specific metadata fields. For example, data consumed from an Azure Event Hubs input includes an EventEnqueuedUtcTime field indicating the time when the event was received in the event hub.\n\n Note\n\nFor more information about streaming inputs, see Stream data as input into Stream Analytics in the Azure Stream Analytics documentation.\n\nAzure Synapse Analytics outputs\n\nIf you need to load the results of your stream processing into a table in a dedicated SQL pool, use an Azure Synapse Analytics output. The output configuration includes the identity of the dedicated SQL pool in an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace, details of how the Azure Stream Analytics job should establish an authenticated connection to it, and the existing table into which the data should be loaded.\n\nAuthentication to Azure Synapse Analytics is usually accomplished through SQL Server authentication, which requires a username and password. Alternatively, you can use a managed identity to authenticate. When using an Azure Synapse Analytics output, your Azure Stream Analytics job configuration must include an Azure Storage account in which authentication metadata for the job is stored securely.\n\n Note\n\nFor more information about using an Azure Synapse Analytics output, see Azure Synapse Analytics output from Azure Stream Analytics in the Azure Stream Analytics documentation.\n\nAzure Data Lake Storage Gen2 outputs\n\nIf you need to write the results of stream processing to an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 container that hosts a data lake in an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace, use a Blob storage/ADLS Gen2 output. The output configuration includes details of the storage account in which the container is defined, authentication settings to connect to it, and details of the files to be created. You can specify the file format, including CSV, JSON, Parquet, and Delta formats. You can also specify custom patterns to define the folder hierarchy in which the files are saved - for example using a pattern such as YYYY/MM/DD to generate a folder hierarchy based on the current year, month, and day.\n\nYou can specify minimum and maximum row counts for each batch, which determines the number of output files generated (each batch creates a new file). You can also configure the write mode to control when the data is written for a time window - appending each row as it arrives or writing all rows once (which ensures \"exactly once\" delivery).\n\n Note\n\nFor more information about using a Blob storage/ADLS Gen2 output, see Blob storage and Azure Data Lake Gen2 output from Azure Stream Analytics in the Azure Stream Analytics documentation.\n\nNeed help?
